The Applications dashboard helps you understand which applications are generating traffic to your APIs and how actively they are being used.

## Access the dashboard

To access the Applications dashboard, navigate to *Business Insights > Applications*.

What you can see in this view depends on your role and the ownership of the assets.

| Role                                       | Access                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Engage Admin**                           | Can see all application usage across the Marketplace       |
| **Catalog Manager**                        | Can see usage for assets owned by their team, as long as the API or Product is also owned by their team |
| **Insights Viewer**                        | Same visibility rules as Catalog Manager                   |
| **Developer**                              | Cannot access this screen                                  |

The table lists all applications that match your selected filters. It displays:

* The application name
* The Marketplace it belongs to
* The consumer organization and team that owns the application
* The total usage for the selected unit (for example, number of transactions)

Only usage that is tied to a quota-backed metric is shown, so the data reflects what counts against the plan quota.

## Filtering options

You can filter the data by application, product, or time range.

Click on an individual application to open a detailed view showing its usage broken down by API.
