## Access the dashboard

To access the dashboard, navigate to *Business Insights > Engagement > Consumer Engagement*.
The dashboard is organized into two main sections:

* **Current Totals** – A snapshot of the total counts across consumer organizations, teams, users, subscriptions, and credentials.
* **Consumer Activity** – A time-based view that shows new and active entities within the selected date range.

The Consumer Engagement dashboard is visible to the following roles:
