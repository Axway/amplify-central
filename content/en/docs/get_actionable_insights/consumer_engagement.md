The dashboard is organized into two main sections:

* **Current Totals** – A snapshot of the total counts across consumer organizations, teams, users, subscriptions, and credentials.
* **Consumer Activity** – A time-based view that shows new and active entities within the selected date range.

You can use the filters at the top of the dashboard to refine your view.

## Filtering options

You can narrow down the dashboard metrics using the available filters:

* **Marketplace**: Lists all marketplaces you have access to.
* **Consumer Organization**: Lists all consumer orgs within those marketplaces, including your current org.
