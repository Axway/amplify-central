Creating an environment is a prerequisite for connecting an agent. Agents use the environment definition to establish communication with the correct data plane, enabling automated API discovery, traffic collection, and lifecycle management. Without an environment, an agent cannot be registered or synchronized with Amplify Engage.

Learn how to create an environment to represent your API services and other discovered objects.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have:

* A valid entitlement to Amplify Engage.
* Engage Admin permissions.

## Create an environment

Follow these steps to create an environment.

### Open the Environments page

1. Navigate to *Topology > Environments*.
2. Click **+ Add New Environment**.

    ![Add New Environment button on Environment List Page.](/Images/central/EnvironmentListPage.png "Add New Environment button")

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you’ve already reached your environment quota, the button will be disabled. Check your entitlement to confirm limits.{{< /alert >}}

### Complete the environment profile

Provide basic details about the environment:

* **Environment Name** - A short friendly display name.
* **Environment Type** - Choose the gateway or system type (for example, AWS API Gateway, Azure API Gateway).
    * Custom/SDK - For community agents or SDK-based agents.
    * Manual - For environments without an agent.
* **Production** - Select **Yes** if this is a production data plane or connects to a non-Axway gateway. The usage will count against your entitled quota.
* **Governance** - Select **Axway Manage** if hosted in Axway Managed Cloud.
* **Description** - Brief description of the environment.
* **Image** -Upload an icon to help identify this environment.

Click **Next** to continue.

### (Optional) Credential preferences

You can control how credentials behave in this environment:

* Set the **Credential Expiration** (in days). You can also:

    * Automatically deprovision expired credentials.
    * Send consumers notifications before expiration (30, 14, 7, 3, 1 day).

* Decide how long consumers can see credential values in Marketplace. Set the **Credential value visibility** to Always visible, 3 days(default) or max 365 days.

Click **Next**.

### (Optional) Stage assignment

Stages in Amplify Engage represent the different phases of the API lifecycle and are a key mechanism for organizing the API landscape. Common examples include development, testing, and production.

* Select one or more stages for the environment.
* Choose a default stage (applied automatically to endpoints).

For details, see [Add and manage stages](/docs/connect_manage_environ/stage).

Click **Next**.

### (Optional) Compliance profiles

Enable compliance or security rules to apply to all APIs discovered in this environment.

* Choose from existing design/security rulesets or upload custom ones under *Topology > Compliance Profiles*.
  
Amplify Engage includes an embedded Spectral linting server that provides real-time compliance checks along with visualizations of the results.

### Access rights

Share the environment with other teams if needed:

* Select a **team owner**.
* Grant **read** or **edit** access to one or more teams.

By default, only the Engage Admin and members of the owning team have access. For details, see [Environment Access Rights](/docs/connect_manage_environ/manage_environments_ownership).

### Finalize

Add tags and attributes to finish creating your environment:

1. Add any tags and attributes to help organize and filter environments.
2. Click **Save**.

Your environment is now created and ready for agent connection.

## Edit an environment

You can update an environment at any time — for example, to change profile details or adjust access and compliance settings.

To edit an environment:

1. Navigate to *Topology > Environments*.
2. From the list, select the environment you want to update.
3. Click **Edit Environment**.

   ![Edit Environment button displayed on the Environments page.](/Images/central/Environment_Details_Edit.png "Edit Environment button")

4. You can edit:  
   * **Environment Profile** – Name, production flag, governance type, description, image, and configuration (AWS, Apigee X, GitHub, etc.).
   * **Compliance Profile** – Default design or security rules.
   * **Credential Preferences** – Expiration and visibility rules for newly created credentials.
   * **Stage Assignment** – Default or multiple stages (e.g., Dev, Test, Prod).
   * **Access Rights** – Change team ownership or change which teams can view the environment.
   * **Tags & Attributes** – Labels and metadata for filtering/search.

5. Click **Save & Exit** to apply changes.
