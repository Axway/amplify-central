Use the following environment variables to control your Discovery and Traceability agents.

The Discovery and Traceability agents share many parameters, which are located in:

* `da_env_vars.env` (Discovery Agent)
* `ta_env_vars.env` (Traceability Agent)

The agent (binary mode) will accept an argument pointing to the environment variables file, which you can point to either `da_env_vars.env` or `ta_env_vars.env`. Use the --envFile `da_env_vars.env` argument with either agent, pointing to the file for that agent.

The Docker image of the agent expects either `da_env_vars.env` or `ta_env_vars.env` as an argument of the Docker runner `docker run --env-file <PATH>/da_env_vars.env...`

Some variables/properties have known default values, so it is not necessary to parameterize them.

## Minimum recommended variables

Use the following environment variables as a starting point to easily switch from one environment to another.

### Discovery Agent

```
#
#API Manager connectivity
#
APIMANAGER_HOST=ApiManagerHostName (localhost by default)
APIMANAGER_PORT=ApiManagerPortNumber (8075 by default)
APIMANAGER_AUTH_USERNAME=AnApiManagerUserName
APIMANAGER_AUTH_PASSWORD=AnApiManagerUserPassword
#
#API Central connectivity
#
CENTRAL_AUTH_CLIENTID=AnApiCentralServiceAccountClientId
CENTRAL_AUTH_PRIVATEKEY=<path>/to/private_key.pem
CENTRAL_AUTH_PUBLICKEY=<path>/to/public_key.pem
CENTRAL_ORGANIZATIONID=TheOrganizationIDfromEnterpriseMarketplace
CENTRAL_ENVIRONMENT=EnterpriseMarketplaceEnvironmentName
#
#Marketplace Provisioning and Deprovisioning
#
# enable the gRPC communication with Amplify platform. Be sure the http/2 connectivity is allowed to cross your firewall/proxy if any.
CENTRAL_GRPC_ENABLED=true
# activate the Marketplace provisioning feature
AGENTFEATURES_MARKETPLACEPROVISIONING=true
# enable to store a cache locally when agent is stopped. It enables the agent to resume his treatment from where it left when restarting.
AGENTFEATURES_PERSISTCACHE=true
```

### Traceability Agent

```
#
#API Manager connectivity
#
APIMANAGER_HOST=ApiManagerHostName (localhost by default)
APIMANAGER_PORT=ApiManagerPortNumber (8075 by default)
APIMANAGER_AUTH_USERNAME=AnApiManagerUserName
APIMANAGER_AUTH_PASSWORD=AnApiManagerUserPassword
#
#API Gateway connectivity
#
APIGATEWAY_HOST=ApiGatewayHostName (localhost by default)
APIGATEWAY_PORT=ApiGatewayPortNumber (8090 by default)
APIGATEWAY_AUTH_USERNAME=AnApiGatewayOperatorUser
APIGATEWAY_AUTH_PASSWORD=AnApiGatewayOperatorUserPassword
#
#API Central connectivity
#
CENTRAL_AUTH_CLIENTID=AnApiCentralServiceAccountClientId
CENTRAL_AUTH_PRIVATEKEY=<path>/to/private_key.pem
CENTRAL_AUTH_PUBLICKEY=<path>/to/public_key.pem
CENTRAL_ORGANIZATIONID=TheOrganizationIDfromEnterpriseMarketplace
CENTRAL_ENVIRONMENT=EnterpriseMarketplaceEnvironmentName
#
#Reporting Traffic to Consumer Insights
#
# enable the gRPC communication with Amplify platform. Be sure the http/2 connectivity is allowed to cross your firewall/proxy if any.
CENTRAL_GRPC_ENABLED=true
# activate the Marketplace provisioning feature
AGENTFEATURES_MARKETPLACEPROVISIONING=true
# enable to store a cache locally when agent is stopped. It enables the agent to resume his treatment from where it left when restarting.
AGENTFEATURES_PERSISTCACHE=true
# enable to add sampling based on consumer and subscription information so each consumer can see a certain percentage of the traffic
TRACEABILITY_PER_SUBSCRIPTION=true
```

If you are either struggling with a variable value or want to benefit from the advanced agents features (API filtering / SSL security / proxy access / logging), the following section describes the variables the agents (Discovery / Traceability) rely on.

## Complete variable list for advanced features

You can extend the previous minimum variable list with the following variables. Some are common to all agents and some are specific to an agent.

### Common variables to both agents
