## Troubleshooting

This section describe the common error cases you can encounter when using agents for the first time. If your error is not listed, please check the [Understand the agent log](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_api_manager/tips-troubleshooting-and-limitations/#understand-the-agent-logs) and [Error Codes and Mitigations](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_api_manager/tips-troubleshooting-and-limitations/#error-codes-and-mitigations) sections.

## Understand the agent logs

Each log is displayed in a JSON format following this pattern: {"level":"info|debug|trace|warn","msg":"messageFromTheAgentGoesHere","time":"messageTimestamp"}

The agent logging mechanism is based on logrus (<https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus>) and can display several levels of information:

* **info** (default): informative log about the agent activity (start, stop, discovering API, publishing traffic, etc.).
* **debug**: same as info level plus some troubleshooting information (healthcheck, connection to Central / Gateway, etc.).
* **trace**: same as debug plus all information related to API call (action / duration / return code / endpoint).

The log level definition is provided using the `LOG_LEVEL` variable set in the agent configuration file.

The logs can be redirected either to stdout (default) or a file, or both (only applicable for discovery agent), using the `LOG_OUTPUT` variable set in the agent configuration file.

```shell
# redirecting log to stdout (Discovery / Traceability agents)
LOG_OUTPUT=stdout

# redirecting log to file (Discovery / Traceability agents)
LOG_OUTPUT=file

# redirecting log to output and file (Discovery agent only)
LOG_OUTPUT=both
```

For file output, the agent needs to know where to save the file and what the file name is. By default the directory is `logs` where the agent is installed and the file name is based on the binary name you are running: `discovery_agent.log` or `traceability_agent.log`. This configuration can be changed using `LOG_FILE_PATH` and `LOG_FILE_NAME` variables in the agent configuration file. For the `LOG_FILE_PATH`, it is recommended to use an absolute path when running the agent in a non container mode.

```shell
# Sample configuration to redirect the agent logs to a specific directory and a specific file name
LOG_FILE_PATH=/home/APIC-agents/logs
LOG_FILE=agent-da-gtw1.log

# Additional configuration for log rotation and backups
# The max size, in megabytes that a log file can grow to - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_ROTATEEVERYMEGABYTES
# The max number of log file backups to keep - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_KEEPFILES
# The max age of a backup file, in days - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_CLEANBACKUPS
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you change any configuration, you must restart the agent to use the new configuration setting.{{< /alert >}}

## Error Codes and Mitigations

In case an error is encountered, the agent will automatically log it based on the logging definition (stdout and/or file).

The error message format is: `Component - [Error Code _ErrorCode_] error message`.

Below is the list of error codes and possible remediations.

## Limitations

APIs including AWS signing / HTTP Basic / Invoke policy / 2-way SSL security cannot be discovered, as these features are not currently supported in Amplify Central.

A change of front-end image only is not detected. Changing the name of the API will create a new one on Central and not delete the previous one.

If APIM is installed in a Docker container, the request/response headers will not be available for the Traceability Agent to read. In this situation, be sure to set `APIGATEWAY_GETHEADERS=false` in the Traceability Agent environment variables.

## Tips

### API summary

In Axway API Manager, you can edit an unpublished API to include an API summary (description) that displays in the API's Catalog Overview once the API is published. If the API summary field is empty when the API is published, then "API From V7 APIManager" is displayed in the Catalog Overview. To update the API summary once the API is published, you must unpublish the API.

### Variable holding file path

For variable holding file path (`CENTRAL_AUTH_PRIVATEKEY`, `CENTRAL_AUTH_PUBLICKEY` and `LOG_FILE_PATH`), it is recommended to **use absolute path**. This way, the agent can be started from anywhere or as a Linux service without error.
