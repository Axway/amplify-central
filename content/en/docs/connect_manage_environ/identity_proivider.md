Within topology, identity providers can be used with environments to issue OAuth access tokens. They are restricted only to environments that are connected through an Embedded agent.

## Identity providers and environments

An environment might be linked to a specific gateway managing one or more identity providers.

Currently, identity providers can be used with the Azure Embedded agent.

Multiple identity providers can be assigned to an environment.
