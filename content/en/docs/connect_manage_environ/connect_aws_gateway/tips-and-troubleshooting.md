## Troubleshooting

This section describe the common error cases you can encounter when using agents for the first time. If your error is not listed, please check the [Understand the agent log](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_aws_gateway/tips-and-troubleshooting/#understand-the-agent-logs) and [Error Codes and Mitigations](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_aws_gateway/tips-and-troubleshooting/#error-codes-and-mitigations) sections.

| Why can't my agents connect to AWS API Gateway?                                     | Check that agent environment variables `AWS_REGION` and `AWS_QUEUENAME` are valid. Also check that the EC2 instance / ECS fargate instance is up and running.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Why can't my agents connect to Amplify Central?                                     | Go to Amplify Central UI > Access > Service Accounts and make sure that the Service Account is correctly named and valid in `CENTRAL_AUTH_CLIENTID` variable.

If you are using a proxy (`TRACEABILITY_PROXYURL`), make sure the connections are opened correctly. Refer to [Communication ports](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connected_agent_common_reference/network_traffic/#communication-ports). |
| Why isn't my agent status displayed in the environment details page?                | It is possible that your agents and their corresponding resources are not linked together.

## Understand the agent logs

Each log is displayed in a JSON format following this pattern: {"level":"info|debug|trace|warn","msg":"messageFromTheAgentGoesHere","time":"messageTimestamp"}

The agent logging mechanism is based on logrus (<https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus>) and can display several levels of information:

* **info** (default): informative log about the agent activity (start, stop, discovering API, publishing traffic, etc.).
* **debug**: same as info level plus some troubleshooting information (healthcheck, connection to Central / Gateway, etc.).
* **trace**: same as debug plus all information related to API call (action / duration / return code / endpoint).

The log level definition is provided using the `LOG_LEVEL` variable set in the agent configuration file.

All agents logs are redirected to CloudWatch. For accessing the logs, log into Amazon console and navigate to CloudWatch service > Logs > Log groups. You will see the two agent logs there: `amplify-discovery-agent.log` and `amplify-traceability-agent.log`. Each log stream will contain the agent logs.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you change any configuration, you must re-upload your agent environment variable files into the s3 bucket used during installation and restart your EC2 / ECS Fargate instance to use the new configuration setting.{{< /alert >}}

## Error Codes and Mitigations

In case an error is encountered, the agent will automatically log it based on the logging definition.

The error message format is: `Component - [Error Code _ErrorCode_] error message`.

Below is the list of error codes and possible remediations.
