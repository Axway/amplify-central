Use the following environment variables to control your Discovery and Traceability agents.

To maintain a shareable collection of environment files, you can create a `da_env_vars.env` (Discovery Agent) and `ta_env_vars.env` (Traceability Agent) file per environment, which contains simple key value pairs.  By default, agent configuration files are looking for corresponding environment variables before looking on the configuration file property.
  
Note that the Docker image of the agent is expecting this `da_env_vars.env` or `ta_env_vars.env` as an argument of the Docker runner `docker run --env-file <PATH>/da_env_vars.env...`

Some variables/properties have default values so it is not necessary to set them unless they need to changed.

If you are either struggling with a variable value or you want to benefit from the advanced agents features (SSL security / logging), the following section describes all the variables the agents (Discovery / Traceability) rely on.

## Complete variable list for advance features

You can extend the previous minimum variable list with the following variables. Some are common to all agents and some are specific to an agent.

See [Common agent variables](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connected_agent_common_reference/agent-variables#agent-variables) for variables that are common to all agents.

### Common variables to both agents
