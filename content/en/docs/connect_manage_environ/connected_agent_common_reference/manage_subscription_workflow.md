  A subscription provides the consumer, or subscriber, with the required
  security and endpoint materials to correctly consume the API.

  The security material and/or quota to access an API is configured inside the Gateway either on the Application (Axway API Manager) or the Usage plan (AWS Gateway) or subscription (Azure Gateway).
---
## Supported use cases when consumer subscribes to an API

### API Manager use cases

* **API providers allow the subscriber to create an application** (property `APIMANAGER_ALLOWAPPLICATIONAUTOCREATION=true` set in the discovery agent configuration file): the agent generates the application and adds the access to the API from the newly created application.
* **Application has no access to the API** in Axway API Manager: the agent adds access to the API from the selected application.
* **Application already has access to the API** in Axway API Manager: the agent has nothing to do.

### AWS Gateway use cases

* **API providers allow the subscriber to create a usage plan** (property `AWS_ALLOWUSAGEPLANAUTOCREATION=true` set in the Discovery Agent configuration file): the agent generates the usage plan and adds access to the API from the newly created usage plan.
* **Usage plan has no access to the API** in AWS API Gateway: the agent adds access to the API from the selected usage plan.
* **Usage plan already has access to the API** in AWS API Gateway: the agent has nothing to do.

### Azure Gateway use cases

Each time the agent received an approved subscription, it generates a new subscription/keys in the Azure API Management service and adds the access to the API from the newly created subscription.

## Supported use case for issuing consumer credentials

Each time a consumer subscribes to an API, new credentials (ApiKey / oauth client&secret depending on the API definition) are generated and stored within the selected API Manager application / AWS usage plan / Azure subscription.

## Supported use cases for subscription approval

Each API can define its own approval mode:

* manual (default): an API provider has to approve the subscription before the consumer receives the API credentials.
(Optional) the agent configuration contains webhook information that will be triggered on each subscription state change. The webhook implementation can, for instance, trigger an MS Teams card to a dedicated Teams channel where the API provider will approve the subscription.
* automatic: the subscription is auto-approved without human intervention.

Agent configuration:

```yml
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_APPROVAL_MODE={manual|auto|webhook}
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_URL={The webhook URL that subscription data will be posted to}
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_APPROVAL_WEBHOOK_HEADERS={The headers that will be used when posting data to the webhook url}
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Each API that is discovered contains the subscription approval mode for its corresponding Amplify Central catalog item, which is set when the API is discovered and published. The only way to change a catalog item's subscription approval mode is to update the agent configuration mode (refer to `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_APPROVAL_MODE`), restart the agent, and then rediscover the API.{{< /alert >}}

## Supported use cases for receiving API credentials

Once the subscription is approved, the agent catches this event from Amplify Central and, based on its configuration, can forward the credentials using either an SMTP server or a webhook.

### Email server and email template configuration

The agent configuration contains the access details to an SMTP server (endpoint / port / credentials, if any) and the templates for the emails. Emails can be triggered when the subscription succeeds, fails or when unsubscribes to an API.

#### SMTP server configuration

The following variables are used to identify the SMTP server and its connectivity:

* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST`: SMTP server where the email notifications will originate from.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT`: Port of the SMTP server.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_FROMADDRESS`: Email address which will represent the sender.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME`: Login user for the SMTP server.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD`: Login password for the SMTP server.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE`: The authentication type based on the email server. You may have to refer to the email server properties and specifications. This value defaults to NONE.

Samples of tested email SMTP server:

```yaml
# Google/Gmail server
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT=587
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME=your GMAIL account
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD=application generated GMAIL password (see note below)
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE=PLAIN

# Microsoft office server
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST=smtp.office365.com
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT=587
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME=your Office Mail account
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD=your Office Mail password
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE=LOGIN

# Microsoft outlook server
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT=587
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME=your Outlook Mail account
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD=your Outlook Mail password
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE=PLAIN

# Yahoo email server
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT=587
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME=your Yahoo Mail account
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD=application generated Yahoo password (see note below)
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE=PLAIN

# Amazon Simple Email Service
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.<region>.amazonaws.com
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PORT=587
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_USERNAME=user access key (see note below)
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_PASSWORD=user secret key (see note below)
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_AUTHTYPE=PLAIN
```

You will be required to use an application generated password instead of the actual user email password for the following email servers. Follow the links for application generated passwords.

* Gmail - [Application generated gmail password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). Use this password in place of your actual password in the agent configuration `password:` field.
* Yahoo - [Application generated yahoo password](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-third-party-passwords-sln15241.html). Use this password in place of your actual password in the agent configuration `password:` field.
* [AWS  Simple email service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-smtp.html). Create your [SMTP credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-credentials.html) and use them in the username (ACCESS KEY) and password (SECRET KEY) of the agent configuration.

#### Email templates configuration

 The agent configuration allows you to customize the email template with several properties:

* `{{.CatalogItemURL}}`: url of the catalog item to help consumer find it easily
* `{{.CatalogItemName}}`: name of the catalog item
* `{{.KeyHeaderName}}` / `{{.Key}}`: apiKey header name and apiKey value
* `{{.ClientID}}` /  `{{.ClientSecret}}`: oauth clientID and clientSecret to request the oauth token
* `{{.Message}}`: error message raised by the agent when the subscription fails or the unsubscribe fails
* `{{.AuthTemplate}}`: only available for Amplify Gateway Discovery Agent as this gateway can issue either API Key or Oauth client/secret credentials.

The following variables are used to define the email content and you can customize them:

* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT`: Subject of the email notification for action subscribe. Default is `Subscription Notification`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_BODY`: Body of the email notification for action subscribe. Default is `Subscription created for Catalog Item:  <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}} {{.CatalogItemID}}.</br></a>{{if .IsAPIKey}} Your API is secured using an APIKey credential:header:<b>{{.KeyHeaderName}}</b>/value:<b>{{.Key}}</b>{{else}} Your API is secured using OAuth token. You can obtain your token using grant_type=client_credentials with the following client_id=<b>{{.ClientID}}</b> and client_secret=<b>{{.ClientSecret}}</b>{{end}}`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_UNSUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT`: Subject of the email notification for action unsubscribe. Default is `Subscription Removal Notification`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_UNSUBSCRIBE_BODY`: Body of the email notification for action unsubscribe. Default is `Subscription for Catalog Item: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a> has been unsubscribed`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBEFAILED_SUBJECT`: Subject of the email notification for action subscribe failed. Default is `Subscription Failed Notification`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBEFAILED_BODY`: Body of the email notification for action subscribe failed. Default is `Could not subscribe to CatalogItem: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a>`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_UNSUBSCRIBEFAILED_SUBJECT`: Subject of the email notification for action unsubscribe failed. Default is `Subscription Removal Failed Notification`.
* `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_UNSUBSCRIBEFAILED_BODY` : Body of the email notification for action unsubscribe failed. Default is `Could not unsubscribe to Catalog Item: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a>`.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}`CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_APIKEYS` and `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_OAUTH`are now deprecated but you can still use them. Be sure to use the {{.AuthTemplate}} string in your `CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_BODY` variable for the agent to replace it with appropriate value. Otherwise you can migrate and use the {{if .IsAPIKEY}} ... {{else}}...{{end}} syntax.

```yaml
# sample notification with deprecated variables
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_BODY=Subscription created for Catalog Item=<a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a><br/>{{.AuthTemplate}}<br/>
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_OAUTH=Your API is secured using OAuth token. You can obtain your token using grant_type=client_credentials with the following client_id=<b>${clientID}</b> and client_secret=<b>${clientSecret}</b>.
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SUBSCRIBE_APIKEYS=Your API is secured using an APIKey credential: header: <b>${keyHeaderName}</b> / value: <b>${key}</b>.
```

{{< /alert >}}

```yaml
# emails template are defaulted to the following:
## subscription success
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_SUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT=Subscription Notification
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_SUBSCRIBE_BODY=Subscription created for Catalog Item:  <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}} {{.CatalogItemID}}.</br></a>{{if .IsAPIKey}} Your API is secured using an APIKey credential:header:<b>{{.KeyHeaderName}}</b>/value:<b>{{.Key}}</b>{{else}} Your API is secured using OAuth token. You can obtain your token using grant_type=client_credentials with the following client_id=<b>{{.ClientID}}</b> and client_secret=<b>{{.ClientSecret}}</b>{{end}}

## unsubscribe success
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_UNSUBSCRIBE_SUBJECT=Subscription Removal Notification
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_UNSUBSCRIBE_BODY=Subscription for Catalog Item: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a> has been unsubscribed

## subscription error
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_SUBSCRIBEFAILED_SUBJECT=Subscription Failed Notification
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_SUBSCRIBEFAILED_BODY=Could not subscribe to CatalogItem: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a> with following error: {{.Message}}

## unsubscribe error

CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_SMTP_UNSUBSCRIBEFAILED_BODY=Could not unsubscribe to Catalog Item: <a href= {{.CatalogItemURL}}> {{.CatalogItemName}}</a> with following error: {{.Message}}
```

### webhook notification configuration

The agent configuration contains the webhook details about where to send the payload (catalog asset url / catalog asset name / subscriber email / credentials / action=APPROVE / authtemplate=preconfigure security template sentence).

Agent configuration:

```yml
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK_URL={The webhook URL that subscription notification data will be posted to}
CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_NOTIFICATIONS_WEBHOOK_HEADERS={The headers that will be used when posting data to the webhook url}
```

Webhook payload definition:

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "catalogItemId": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "catalogItemUrl": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "catalogItemName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "action": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "email": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "key": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "keyHeaderName": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "authtemplate": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}
```

The payload is base64 encoded when sent to the webhook endpoint.

Request sample sent to the webhook endpoint:

```json
{
    "headers": {
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip",
        "Host": "<webHook url>",
        "User-Agent": "EnterpriseEdgeGatewayDiscoveryAgent/<agent_version>",
        "Contenttype": "application/json",
        "Content-Length": "485"
    },

    }
}
```

## API provider: subscription preparation

If the API provider does not allow an API consumer to create his Application (Axway API Gateway) or Usage plan (AWS Gateway), then he must prepare the required objects (application/Usage plan) in advance for the API consumer to use. It is not necessary to add credentials at that point; they will be automatically created by the Discovery Agent during the subscription workflow to ensure their uniqueness.

### Axway API Gateway custom field

A custom field track the Amplify Central subscription can be added to the API. Refer to `<API_Gateway_install_dir>/apigateway/webapps//apiportal/vordel/apiportal/app/app.config file` in the **customPropertiesConfig** section. For more details, see [Customize API Manager](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_administration/apimgr_admin/api_mgmt_custom/index.html).

Sample application:

```json
customPropertiesConfig: {
    user: {
            // custom properties...
        },
        organization: {
            // custom properties...
        },
        application: {
            subscriptions: {
                label: 'Subscriptions'
            },
        },
        api: {
            // custom properties...
        }
}
```

## API consumer: subscription workflow

1. A consumer initiates the subscription in Amplify Central:

   1. Open an Amplify Catalog item.
   2. Click **Subscribe**.
   3. Select the Team and API Manager Application name / Usage Plan for which you want to subscribe. For additional information, see [Manage Amplify Catalog subscriptions.](/docs/manage_unified_catalog/manage_subscriptions/)

2. Based on the API subscription approval (manual vs. automatic), an API provider has to approve the subscription.

3. The Discovery Agent receives the subscription event:

   * subscription status: **Active**

      * Subscription ID is automatically added to the **Custom** field of the Application or to the Usage plan.
      * Agent create the credentials on the Gateway and link them to the Application / Usage plan / Subscription.
      * Agent triggers credentials sending (either via email or via webhook).
      * If a failure occurs for any reason during the process, the subscription status is set to: **Subscription failed**. Refer to the Discovery Agent log for more information. You can delete the subscription and start again from Step 1.

4. The subscriber consumes the API:

   * The API can be consumed once the API credential details are received.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Depending on the poll interval settings for the Discovery Agent, it will take a little time from when the user subscribes an API to an application/usage plan/subscription until Amplify Central shows the subscription state of **Active**. This is because of the time it takes to send events back and forth between the Gateway and Amplify Central.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If the FrontEnd API on API Manager corresponding to the Catalog item is set to **unpublished** at the time the subscription is initiated, the Discovery Agent will receive the event, but will not allow the subscription to be completed. Instead, it will send back a subscription status of **Subscribe failed**.{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}The API Manager application and the API must be in the same organization. Otherwise, an error message is displayed in the Discovery Agent log.
**Workaround**: You can grant the API access to the organization where the application belongs:

1. In the UI, select the API.
2. Expand **Manage selected**.
3. Select **Grant access**.
{{< /alert >}}

## Unsubscribe workflow

1. A consumer initiates unsubscribe:

   1. Open the Amplify Catalog and navigate to the **Subscription** tab.
   2. Unsubscribe from the active subscription. For additional information, see [Manage Amplify Catalog subscriptions](/docs/manage_unified_catalog/manage_subscriptions/).

2. The Discovery Agent receives the Unsubscribe event:

   * API Manager: The subscription ID is removed from the application's Custom field. The related credentials are removed too.
   * AWS Gateway: The `subscriptions-<subscriptionID from Amplify Central>` is removed from the usage plan. The related credentials are removed too.
   * Azure: The subscription is deleted.
   * Set the Amplify Central subscription status to **unsubscribed** or **unsubscribe failed** in case or error. Refer to Discovery Agent log for more information of the error.

## Impact on subscription when unpublishing an API in API Manager

1. In API Manager, assume there is a FrontEnd API that is published, has been discovered by the Discovery Agent, and has an active subscription to it in Amplify Central.
2. A user in API Manager unpublishes that API.
3. The Discovery Agent discovers the change and:

   * Initiates an unsubscribe to Amplify Central for that Catalog item.
   * The subscription ID is removed from the application's Custom field.
   * The subscription status is set to **Unsubscribed**.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Depending on the poll interval settings for the Discovery Agent, it will take a little time from when the user unsubscribes an API until Amplify Central shows the subscription state of **Unsubscribed**. This is because of the time it takes to discover the change on API Manager and send events back and forth between API Manager and Amplify Central.{{< /alert >}}

## Impact of subscription approval mode on subscription workflow

The configuration setting for central.subscriptions.approvalmode affects the flow of getting a subscription approved. Allowed settings are **manual**, **auto** and **webhook**. Each of these settings are detailed below.

### Manual approval mode

This is the default setting. In manual approval mode, the subscription approval flow is as follows:

1. A consumer in Amplify Central clicks on **Subscribe**.
2. The subscription status moves to **Waiting for approval...**.
3. The subscription remains in this state until a user with appropriate permissions on Amplify Central locates the subscription and clicks **Approve**.
4. The subscription status moves to **Subscribing**.
5. The Discovery Agent receives the event and sets the status to **Active**, or **Subscribe failed** if there is a failure to subscribe.

### Auto approval mode

In auto approval mode, the subscription approval flow is as described at the top of this page:

1. A consumer in Amplify Central clicks on **Subscribe**.
2. The subscription status moves immediately to **Subscribing...**.
3. The Discovery Agent receives the event and sets the status to **Active**, or **Subscribe failed** if there is a failure to subscribe.

### Webhook approval mode

In webhook approval mode, the Discovery Agent must be configured with a webhook url, and any webhook headers and authentication secret that the webhook needs. Within the webhook, many things are possible. For example, the webhook could either generate an email to notify someone that a subscription is awaiting approval, or the webhook could do the subscription approval. Assuming that the webhook is correctly configured and coded, the subscription approval flow is as follows:

1. A consumer in Amplify Central clicks on **Subscribe**.
2. The subscription status moves to **Waiting for approval...**.
3. The webhook is notified of the event.
4. The subscription remains in this state until the webhook moves the subscription to **Approved**, or a user with appropriate permissions on Amplify Central locates the subscription and clicks **Approve**.
5. The subscription status moves to  **Subscribing**.
6. The Discovery Agent receives the event and sets the status to **Active**, or **Subscribe failed** if there is a failure to subscribe.

{{< alert title="AWS Gateway Note" color="primary" >}}Depending on the poll interval settings for the Discovery Agent, it will take a little time from when the user unsubscribes an API until Amplify Central shows the subscription state of **Unsubscribed**. This is because of the time it takes to discover the change on API Manager and send events back and forth between API Manager and Amplify Central.{{< /alert >}}

## Subscription failures

### API Manager failures

The agent can mark a subscription as **Failed to subscribe** or **Failed to unsubscribe** for any of the following reasons:

|   | Failure Description                                                                                                                                                                    | Remediation                                                                                                                                                                                     |

API Gateway Manager requires an HTTPS connection.                                                                                                               |

### AWS Gateway failures

The agent can mark a subscription as **Failed to subscribe** or **Failed to unsubscribe** for one of several reasons:

1. The API on API Gateway Manager is unpublished.
2. No usage plans have been created on AWS API Gateway.
3. On AWS API Gateway, usage plans have been created but no API stages have been added to the plan for the chosen subscription's API.
4. On AWS API Gateway, no API keys have been added to the subscription's chosen usage plan.
5. The agent fails to communicate with AWS API Gateway.
