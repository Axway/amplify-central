Axway agents (v7 / AWS / Azure) are built using the [agent SDK](https://github.com/Axway/agent-sdk). The common features of agents are inherited from the SDK, such as:

* Connectivity to Amplify platform parameters (`CENTRAL_*`)
* Subscription approval and notification parameters (`CENTRAL_SUBSCRIPTIONS_*`)
* Trace redaction parameters (`TRACEABILITY_REDACTION_*`)
* Common error codes related to the previous features
* Securing credentials in agent configuration
