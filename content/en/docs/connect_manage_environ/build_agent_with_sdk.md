The Amplify Agent SDK is a software development kit that allows you to build custom agents for dataplanes where there is not already an existing Amplify agent. The SDK is implemented in Golang. The Amplify Agent SDK is available publicly and can be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/agent-sdk).

For additional information on the SDK, please refer to the README.md in the GitHub repo.
