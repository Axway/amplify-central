## Add an endpoint to an API service

Before adding an endpoint, you must [add a service](/docs/connect_manage_environ/manage_services/add_api_service). While adding a service, you are prompted to create an endpoint, or you can optionally move past this step and add an endpoint later. To add an endpoint to an existing service, visit the details page of your service, then click **+ Add Endpoint** (located at the top right of the **Endpoints** tab).

1. Enter a **Title** and **Logical Name** for your API service endpoint.
2. Click **+ Create API Endpoint(s)** to expand the optional form where you can add one or more endpoints.
3. Enter information about your API service endpoint:
    * **Protocol**: The transfer protocol used by the API service.
    * **Host**: The domain name or IP address of the API service.
    * **Port**: The port number where the API service is exposed.
    * **Basepath**: The path relative to the host where the API service is deployed.
4. Click **Add and save** to add the endpoint, you can repeat steps 2 and 3 to add more endpoints.
5. Click **Save** to create the endpoint(s).

If you want to add an endpoint to an API service using the Axway Central CLI, please refer to these [docs](/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central/cli_publish) instead.
  
### Errors and debugging

If there is an error while publishing to catalog, the form page will present a large error box explaining the caused of the error. The error may contain references to objects only found when using the CLI or API directly. In this case, please refer to the [Axway CLI](/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central/cli_publish) documentation for further guidance.
