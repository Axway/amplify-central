In this section, you'll learn how to manually create an API Service in your environment, add optional endpoints to the API Service, then publish the endpoints to the Asset Catalog for consumption.

If you want to automate the service discovery from an existing gateway, there are several supported gateways where API Services can be discovered:

* [Axwxay API Gateway](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_api_manager)
* [AWS Gateway](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_aws_gateway)
* [Azure Gateway](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connect_azure_gateway)
* [Istio Gateway](/docs/connect_manage_environ/mesh_management)
