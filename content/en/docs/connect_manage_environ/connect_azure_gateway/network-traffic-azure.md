description: Traffic is always initiated by the Agent to Azure API Manager and Amplify Central. No sessions are ever initiated back to the
  Agent.
---

## Data destinations

The destination for:

* Agent Authentication data is `login.axway.com`
* API definition (Swagger or WSDL) and API documentation data is `apicentral.axway.com`
* API Event data, the transaction summary and headers, is `ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com`
* Subscription notification for getting platform user information is `platform.axway.com`
* API usage statistics, the number of calls placed to, is `https://lighthouse.admin.axway.com`

## Data exchanged

### Discovery Agent

The Discovery Agent sends the following information to the Axway Amplify platform:

* API definition using Swagger or WSDL depending on the API type (REST vs SOAP)
* API documentation

### Traceability Agent

The Traceability Agent reports two sets of data to Amplify platform:

* Usage data
* Transactions data

#### Usage data

The usage data represent the total number of APIs called during a certain period of time. This usage is automatically reported every 15 minutes by default to Amplify platform and cannot be inactivated. See [Reporting Gateway usage event](/docs/connected-agent-common-reference/traceability_usage/#reporting-gateway-usage-event).

It contains the following information:

Structural Fields:

* Unique ID
* Timestamp
* Event Identifier
* Environment Identifier
* Event version

Data Fields:

* Count
* Observation Window (start / end)

#### Transactions data

The transaction data represent the number and details of transactions processed by the Gateway during a period of time. You can limit the number of transactions sent to the platform, or completely turn this feature off, by applying a sampling configuration to the Traceability Agent. See [Sampling](/docs/connected-agent-common-reference/trace_sampling/#sampling).

The transactions can be redacted (by default) and/or sanitized, according to your need, before sending the information to Amplify platform. See [Trace redaction](/docs/connected-agent-common-reference/trace_redaction/).

It contains the following information:

Structural Fields:

* Unique ID
* Timestamp
* Event Identifier
* App Identifier (v7 Gateway application or AWS Usage plan or Azure subscription)
* Amplify Central environment Identifier
* Event version

Data Fields:

* API Identifier
* Transaction status (i.e., HTTP status of the API)
* URLs (frontend / backend API)
* Duration and timestamp
* Service called: method (POST / GETâ€¦) + URI path
* Request/response headers from each API call

## Communication ports

All outbound traffic is sent over SSL via TCP / UDP.

Open the following ports so that agents can communicate to the Amplify platform:

Note: _Region_ column is representing the region where your Amplify organization is deployed. EU means deployed in European data center and US means deployed in US data center. Be sure to use the corresponding _Host_/_Port_ for your agents to operate correctly.

**Inbound**:

The docker container does not expose any ports outside of the container. Within the container the following listen:

| Host             | Port           | Protocol | Data                                                               |
|------------------|----------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Docker Container | 8989 (default) | HTTPS    | Serves the status of the agent and its dependencies for monitoring |

## Validation

### Direct Connection

**Connecting to Amplify Central and Login hosts:**

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://apicentral.axway.com
```

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://login.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to Amplify Central Event Traffic host, HTTPS:**

```shell
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://ingestion.datasearch.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to Amplify Central Event Traffic host, Lumberjack:**

```shell
curl ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com:453
```

A return of **"curl: (52) Empty reply from server"** validates the connection was established.

### Connection via Proxy

**Connecting to Amplify Central and Login hosts:**

```shell
curl -x {{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://apicentral.axway.com
```

```shell
curl -x {{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}"  https://login.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to Amplify Central Event Traffic host, HTTPS:**

```shell
curl -x {{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://ingestion.datasearch.axway.com
```

A return of **"200"** validates the connection was established.

**Connecting to Amplify Central Event Traffic host, Lumberjack:**

```shell
curl -x socks5://{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com:453
```

A return of **"curl: (52) Empty reply from server"** validates the connection was established.

## Troubleshooting

### Curl connection to ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com

* **Error:**

  ```shell
  curl: (6) Could not resolve host: ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com
  ```

  * **Cause:** The host making the call canâ€™t resolve the ingestion-lumberjack DNS name.

  * **Possible Resolution:** Tell curl to resolve the hostname on the proxy:

      ```shell
      curl -x socks5h://{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}} ingestion-lumberjack.datasearch.axway.com
      ```

* **Error:**

  ```shell
  curl: (7) No authentication method was acceptable.
  ```

  * **Cause:** The SOCKS proxy server expected an authentication type other than what was specified.

  * **Possible Resolution:** Provide authentication to the proxy:

      ```shell
      socks5://{{username}}:{{password}}@{{proxy_host}}:{{proxy_port}}
      ```

      The Agents only support the use of username/password authentication method for SOCKS connections.
