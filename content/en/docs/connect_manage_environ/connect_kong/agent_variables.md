Use the following environment variables to control your Discovery Agent.

To maintain a shareable collection of environment files, you can create a `da_env_vars.env` (Discovery Agent). By default, agent configuration files are looking for corresponding environment variables before looking on the configuration file property.
  
{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}} The Docker image of the agent is expecting this `da_env_vars.env` as an argument of the Docker runner `docker run --env-file <PATH>/da_env_vars.env...`{{% /alert %}}

Some variables/properties have a default value so there is no need set them unless there is a change.

## Complete variable list for advance features

You can extend the previous minimum variable list with the following variables. Some are common to all agents, and some are specific to an agent.

### Common variables to both agents

All common agent variables can be found [here](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connected_agent_common_reference/agent-variables#agent-variables).
