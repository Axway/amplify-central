description: Learn how to set up tag-based condition expressions using the
  APIMANAGER_FILTER environment variable to discover APIs that could be added to
  Amplify Central.
---

Conditional expressions statements use logical operators to compare values. This section provides sample syntax for defining expressions.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}For tag-based filtering, the conditional expression should have “tag” as the prefix / selector in the symbol name. The expression can be a simple condition or a compound condition in which multiple conditions are evaluated using logical operators. See Logical operators and Comparative operators, below.{{< /alert >}}

```
tag.<tagName> == <tagValue>
```

## Before you start

* Review Logical operators and Comparative operators

## Objectives

Learn how to set filtering based on tag name, tag value, partial value and MatchRegEx to discover APIs that can be published to Amplify Central.

## Filter based on tag name

```
tag.<tagName>.Exists() == true | false
```

Sample to discover all APIs having a tag name API_TYPE: ```filter: tag.API_TYPE.Exists() == true```  
Sample to discover all APIs not having a tag name API_TYPE: ```filter: tag.API_TYPE.Exists() == false```  

## Filter based on tag value

```
tag.Any() == | != <tagValue>
```

Sample to discover all APIs having a tag that has Finance in its value: ```filter: tag.Any() == Finance```  
Sample to discover all APIs having a tag that does not have Finance in its value: ```filter: tag.Any() != Finance```  

## Filter based on tag name and tag value

```
tag.<tagName> == | != <tagValue>
```

Sample to discover all APIs having a tag name API_TYPE that has 'Finance' in its value: ```filter: tag.API_TYPE == Finance```  
Sample to discover all APIs having a tag name API_TYPE that does not have 'Finance' in its value: ```filter: tag.API_TYPE !=  Finance```  

## Filter based on partial value

```
tag.<tagName>.contains(<value>) == true |  false
```

Sample to  discover all APIs having a tag name containing API: ```tag.API_TYPE.contains(API) == true```  
Sample to  discover all APIs having a tag name not containing API: ```tag.API_TYPE.contains(API) == false```  

## Filter using MatchRegEx

```
tag.<tagName>.matchRegEx(<regularExpression>)
```

## Logical operators

Logical operators are used for evaluating multiple conditions. These can be combined with comparative operators and any of the above expressions.

| Operator | Description                                                                |   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| `&&`      | Logical AND operator, returns true if conditions on both sides are true.   |   |
| \|\|       | Logical OR operator, returns true if the condition on either side is true. |   |

## Comparative operators

Comparative operators are used for comparing two values. These can be combined with logical operators and any of the above expressions.

| Operator | Description                                                                                                    |   |
|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| `==`       | Equal to operator, returns true if values on both sides are equal.                                             |   |
| `!=`       | Not equal to operator, returns true if the value on the left side is not equal to the value on the right side. |   |

Sample of a composite expression to discover APIs having Math as a tag name OR APIs having a tag name API_TYPE whose value is 'Healthcare' and exclude APIs having a tag name API_TYPE whose value is 'SOAP': ```tag.Math.Exists() == true || tag.API_TYPE == Healthcare || tag.API_TYPE != SOAP```
