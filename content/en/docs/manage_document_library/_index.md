The Document Library allows user to centralize their documentation. This centralized documentation can then be referenced in Product Documentation or in the Marketplace settings (footer link / menus link). When modifying the documentation, the changes are immediately visible on the objects using it.

## What is the Document Library?

The Document Library is a collection of resuable documentation. Use the Document Library WebUI to:

* Upload existing documents into the library
* Create Markdown documents (coming soon)
* Use external documentation links (coming soon)
