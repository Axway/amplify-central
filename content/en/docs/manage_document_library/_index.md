The Document Library allows user to centralize their documentation. This centralized documentation can then be referenced in Product Documentation or in the Marketplace settings (footer link / menus link). When modifying the documentation, the changes are immediately visible on the objects using it.

## What is the Document Library?

The Document Library is a collection of reusable documentation. Use the Document Library WebUI to:

* Upload existing documents into the library
* Create Markdown documents
* Use external documentation links
* Create documentation templates

Document Library is only available if you have the "Public Marketplace" entitlement and more than one marketplace configured. Refer to [your entitlement](https://platform.axway.com/org) and your commercial representative for further help.
