## General usage limitations

Your use of the Amplify APIs (collectively, the "APIs") is subject to certain limitations designed to ensure the stability, security, and performance of the services for all users.

## Default rate limit

Unless otherwise explicitly agreed upon in a separate written agreement or specified in the API documentation for a particular API endpoint, your use of the APIs is subject to a default request rate limit. The default usage limit for all listed Amplify APIs is capped at 25 requests per minute (RPM) per client.

## Consequences of exceeding limits

If you exceed the specified rate limits, we reserve the right to take temporary or permanent action, including:

* Throttling: Denying API requests that exceed the limit.
* Suspension: Temporarily suspending access to the APIs.

## Limit increases

If your business needs require a higher rate limit than the default, you may submit a request for a (temporary) limit increase through the designated support channel. Approval of any such request is at our sole discretion and may be subject to additional terms and conditions.
