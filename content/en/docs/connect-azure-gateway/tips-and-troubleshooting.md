## Troubleshooting

This section describe the common error cases you can encounter when using agents for the first time. If your error is not listed, please check the [Understand the agent log](/docs/connect-azure-gateway/tips-and-troubleshooting/#understand-the-agent-logs) and [Error Codes and Mitigations](/docs/connect-azure-gateway/tips-and-troubleshooting/#error-codes-and-mitigations) sections.

## Understand the agent logs

Each log is displayed in a JSON format following this pattern: {"level":"info|debug|trace|warn","msg":"messageFromTheAgentGoesHere","time":"messageTimestamp"}

The agent logging mechanism is based on logrus (<https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus>) and can display several levels of information:

* **info** (default): informative log about the agent activity (start, stop, discovering API, publishing traffic, etc.).
* **debug**: same as info level plus some troubleshooting information (healthcheck, connection to Central / Gateway, etc.).
* **trace**: same as debug plus all information related to API call (action / duration / return code / endpoint).

The log level definition is provided using the `LOG_LEVEL` variable set in the agent configuration file.

The logs can be redirected either to stdout (default) or a file, or both (only applicable for discovery agent), using the `LOG_OUTPUT` variable set in the agent configuration file.

```shell
# redirecting log to stdout (Discovery / Traceability agents)
LOG_OUTPUT=stdout

# redirecting log to file (Discovery / Traceability agents)
LOG_OUTPUT=file

# redirecting log to output and file (Discovery agent only)
LOG_OUTPUT=both
```

For file output, the agent needs to know where to save the file and what the file name is. By default, the directory is `logs` where the agent is installed and the file name is based on the binary name you are running: `discovery_agent.log` or `traceability_agent.log`. This configuration can be changed using `LOG_FILE_PATH` and `LOG_FILE_NAME` variables in the agent configuration file. For the `LOG_FILE_PATH`, it is recommended to use an absolute path when running the agent in a non container mode.

```shell
# Sample configuration to redirect the agent logs to a specific directory and a specific file name
LOG_FILE_PATH=/home/APIC-agents/logs
LOG_FILE=agent-da-resgrp1.log

# Additional configuration for log rotation and backups
# The max size, in megabytes that a log file can grow to - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_ROTATEEVERYMEGABYTES
# The max number of log file backups to keep - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_KEEPFILES
# The max age of a backup file, in days - no limit by default.
LOG_FILE_CLEANBACKUPS
```

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}If you change any configuration, you must restart the agent to use the new configuration setting.{{< /alert >}}

## Error Codes and Mitigations

In case an error is encountered, the agent will automatically log it based on the logging definition (stdout and/or file).

The error message format is: `Component - [Error Code _ErrorCode_] error message`.

Below is the list of error codes and possible remediations.
