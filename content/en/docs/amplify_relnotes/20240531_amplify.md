| 01550495    | APIGOV-27558 | **Issue**: The Category filter in the product list is limited to only 100 categories. <br />**Resolution**: The first 100 categories are visible.

The more release the more time it takes. The number of generated events has been decreased to not overload the system. |

### Unified Catalog announcements

The statistics related to Unified Catalog have been turned off in preparation of the deprecation of the Unified Catalog feature. Users can no longer see how many times a Unified Catalog item has been viewed (from the list and the catalog item details views).

A migration script to move to Marketplace is available on [Axway GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-migration).

A deprecation banner is visible from the Unified Catalog informing of the deprecation. The banner adapt itself based on the role of the user: consumer VS provider.
