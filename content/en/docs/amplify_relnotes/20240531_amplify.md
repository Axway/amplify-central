|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 01550495    | APIGOV-27558 | **Issue**: The Category filter in product list is limited to only 100 categories. <br />**Resolution**: The first 100 category are visible. The filter now has an indicator of the total category number present in the system. It is also possible to search for category: the request is performed on the server side and not on the category visible in the WebUI. |
| 01582703    | APIGOV-27711 | **Issue**: Archiving/deleting product that have more than thousand releases is not possible. <br />**Resolution**: When archiving a product, it triggers some events in the system to removed all dependencies (releases, plan, publication...). the more release you have and the more time it takes. We have decreased the number of generated events to not overload the system. |
|             | APIGOV-26233 / APIGOV-26232 | **Issue**: Unlink an asset that is used in a product plan quota should not be allowed. <br />**Resolution**: The UI and the API prevent now to unlink an asset from a product whenever the asset resources are used in the product plan quotas. |

### Unified Catalog announcements

The statistics related to Unified Catalog have been turned off in preparation of the deprecation of the Unified Catalog feature. Users can no longer see how many times a Unified Catalog item has been viewed (from the list and the catalog item details views).

A migration script to move to Marketplace is available on [Axway GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-migration).

A deprecation banner is visible from the Unified Catalog informing of the deprecation. The banner adapt itself based on the role of the user: consumer VS provider.
