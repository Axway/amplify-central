* **Selected version UX improvement** - A button has been added to display the currently selected Product version when the selected version scrolls out of view. An up arrow button is displayed when the user scrolls away from the top of the list.
* **One-time product plans** - The ability to charge a one-time setup fee in addition to the regular recurrent subscription charges. This pricing structure allows providers to charge an upfront cost that is not tied to a recurrent subscription. For instance, providers can configure a paid product plan that charges a one-time setup fee in addition to a usage based montly subscription. Alternatively, they can charge a fixed one-time fee for the consumption of all included resources. See [Configure paid plan - base price](/docs/manage_product_foundry/manage_product_plans#configure-a-quota).

#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **Long Marketplace name overlapping the product status** - Previously, long Marketplace names overlapped the Marketplace status field on the Publish to Marketplace side panel. Now, long Marketplace names appear truncated.
* **Line break issue in description fields** - The product description can now handle line breaks.
* **Resource version not visible when creating a plan quota** - When creating a plan quota, the resource name is enriched to display: *{assetTitle}/{resourceTitle} - {stageTitle} - {stateName} - {Version}*. When viewing the plan quota details, the information is displayed in a table format.
* **System-initiated events logged with a platform user account** - All actions initiated by the system, such as upgrade / migration codes, are now reported in the Activity events as being performed by **Axway Internal Admin** user.
* **Impossible to delete a stage** - Previously, it was not possible to remove a stage, even after it was no longer in use. This was caused by some remaining references on the environments that were still pointing to the stage. An upgrade procedure cleans up the invalid references and triggers a stage update event in the Activity log that is now reported as performed by the Axway Internal Admin user.

#### Known issues for Product Foundry

There are no known limitations in this release.
