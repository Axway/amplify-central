New enhancement for the May 12 update.

### Axway Engage CLI update for April 12, 2025

* **Introducing Axway Engage CLI**

  (NEW CLI RELEASES)</br>
  The latest version **[3.15.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axway/axway-central-cli/v/3.14.0)** of the Axway Engage CLI is now available on NPM. This update includes:
    * The Axway Engage CLI now includes a new `productize` command, which automates the creation of an Asset and a Product for a given API Service. This allows you to use shell scripts to bulk-create assets and products for multiple API Services. A sample script demonstrating this process is available in the updated documentation here.  (Lisa to add link to the updated doc)
    * Starting with version 3.14.0, the Axway Central CLI supports commands for both 'Axway Central' and 'Axway Engage'.

* **Limit on API Services grouped under a single asset**

  (PROVIDER EXPERIENCE, ASSET CATALOG, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Asset Catalog now enforces a maximum of **150 API Services** that can be grouped under a single asset. If your use case requires grouping more than 150 apis, consider creating multiple assets to organize them effectively.

## May 8, 2025

New enhancement for the May 8 update.

### Marketplace update for May 8, 2025

* **Improved Applications Details screen**
  
  (CONSUMER EXPERIENCE, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Application Details screen has been redesigned to display the information in a clearer, more organized way. The new layout contains two separate tabs: *Credentials* and *Resources*. The Request Credential experience has also been improved to better represent when a credential can be used with multiple resources. Refer to [View an application](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/application_management#view-an-application)

* **APIM Discovery Agent: Credential Request Definitions for multiple Inbound Security Policies**
  
  (APIM DISCOVERY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
