| 01713319 | APIGOV-30367 | **Issue**: All traceability agents were displayed with an unhealthy status while traffic metrics were not affected.   <br/>**Resolution**: A fix was made for handling an error while updating the traceability agent status. |
| 01702598 | APIGOV-30220 | **Issue**: The Kafka discovery agent encountered a 409 status error while updating an AccessRequestDefinition.   <br/>**Resolution**: Additional checks were made to only create/update the AccessRequestDefinition if changes are detected. |

### Marketplace updates for May 2, 2025

* **Asset Request Definition Cleanup**
  
  (PROVIDER EXPERIENCE, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  An enhancement has been implemented to improve the configuration consistency in the Asset Catalog. When an *Access Request Definition* is deleted, the system will now automatically remove the corresponding *Asset Request Definition* - if one exists. This prevents orphaned configuration resources.
