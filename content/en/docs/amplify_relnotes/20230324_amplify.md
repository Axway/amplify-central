#### Axway Agent SDK

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

##### Enhancements for Axway Agent SDK

* **Platform URL update for Amplify event traffic** - A change was made to the URL receiving the Amplify event traffic. Older agents can still send to the old URL, as the event traffic will be proxied to the new URL.

##### Bug fixes for Axway Agent SDK

* **Reduction on Amplify event traffic** - If the Agent was not able to start up properly, extra state change events were sent to the Amplify platform during startup. Now, updates are only sent when the status of the agent changes from the prior status.

* **Traceability Agent sending duplicate metrics events** - During the startup of the Traceability Agent, it was possible to generate duplicate traffic usage counts for API Services. Now, traffic events are not counted until there is sufficient information (API service, access request and subscription) to identify duplicate usage traffic.

* **Handling of duplicate Unified Catalog categories** - If a new Unified Catalog item was being published/created with the same Title and Category of an existing item, an attempt to create a duplicate category would cause an error. Now, the existing older category is used for the new category to enable the successful publishing of a Catalog.
