#### Axway Agent SDK

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

##### Enhancements for Axway Agent SDK

* **Platform URL update for Amplify event traffic** - A change was made to the URL receiving the Amplify event traffic.  Older agent can still send to the older URL as the event traffic will be proxied to the new URL.  It is recommended to update Agents to have all the latest bug fixes.  

##### Bug fixes for Axway Agent SDK

* **Reduction on Amplify event traffic** - In the Agent is not able to startup properly, a number of extra state change events would be sent to the Amplify platform un-neccessarily during startup.  A fix was made to the startup logic to only send updates when the status of the agent changes from the prior status.

* **Traceability Agent sending duplicate metrics events** - During the startup of the Traceability Agent, it was possible to generate duplicate traffic usage counts for API services.  A fix was made to not count traffic events until there was sufficient information (i.e. API service, access request and subscription) to identify a duplicate usage traffic.

* **Handling of duplicate Unified Catalog Categories** - If a new Unified Catalog item is being published/created with the same Title and Category of an existing item, an attempt to create a duplicate category would cause an error.  A fix was maded to use the existing older Category and not create a new Catgory to enable the pubishing of a Catalog item to succeed.
