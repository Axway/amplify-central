## July 23, 2025

New features, enhancements, and bug fix for the July 23 update.

### Marketplace updates for July 23, 2025

* **Email notifications for subscriptions and application registrations workflows**

  (CONSUMER EXPERIENCE, PROVIDER EXPERIENCE, NEW FEATURE)</br>
  **Automated email notifications** on subscriptions and application registration events have been introduced to ensure timely action on incoming subscription and application registration requests and deliver a more responsive experience for consumers. This enhancement includes:
  
    * **Engage Admin** and **Subscription Approver** role assignees receive an email notification when a new **subscription request** is submitted for a product owned by their team and requires manual approval.
    * **Engage Admin** role assignees receive an email notification when a new **application registration request** is submitted for an API owned by their team and requires manual approval.
    * **Consumers** and **Subscriber** role assignees in the requesting team receive an email notification when their **subscription request** has been **approved or rejected**.
    * **Consumers** and **Subscriber** role assignees in the requesting team receive an email notification when their **application registration request** has been **approved or rejected**.

* **Configurable credential visibility duration**

  (PROVIDER EXPERIENCE, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  Engage now allows providers to define how long generated credentials remain viewable in the Marketplace after they are issued. Previously, credential visibility was fixed at 3 days, with no ability to modify this behavior. A new setting is now available in the **Credential Preferences** screen of an Environment to define the number of days credentials remain visible in the Marketplace. This configuration affects all credentials generated for APIs within that environment. The **default value is 3 days** if no customization is made. This enhancement gives providers more control over credential security policies.

* **Consumer role updates**

  (ACCESS RIGHTS, ENHANCEMENT)  
  Users with the **Consumer Organization Role** who were previously assigned one of the following producer team-level roles had those roles automatically **unassigned** to align with the intended usage and boundaries of the Consumer Organization role:

    * Developer
    * Catalog Manager
    * Marketplace Manager
    * Subscription Approver

  Going forward, users with the Consumer Organization Role may only be assigned a **Consumer** and/or **Subscriber** team-level role. This change helps enforce clear boundaries between producer and consumer responsibilities and simplifies access control management across Amplify Engage.

* **Enhanced customization for status elements and action buttons**

  (MARKETPLACE CUSTOMIZATION, BRANDING, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  Marketplace Administrators can now more precisely align the Marketplace appearance with their company’s brand guidelines. Previously, the Marketplace applied a single global font color, which limited the ability to style status elements (badges) and action buttons independently. This update includes the following changes:

    * **Status elements font color**: A new setting in the Marketplace Theme configuration allows Marketplace Manager users to customize the font color of status elements independently from the global font color.
    * **Action button text color**: Another new setting allows marketplace managers to configure the text color of action buttons separately, ensuring better contrast and improved brand alignment.

* **SEO support using the Marketplace Description property**

  (DISCOVERABILITY, SEO, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Marketplace description defined in the settings is now automatically included in the HTML "head" section as the page description meta tag to improve search engine optimization (SEO) and make Marketplace instances discoverable. This change allows search engines to better index and rank the Marketplace site using the administrator-defined description.

* **Credential type now visible in Marketplace Applications**

  (CONSUMER EXPERIENCE, APPLICATION, ENHANCEMENT)</br>

This update allows users to view the kind of credentials associated with their applications, making it easier to manage and differentiate between various authentication methods.
