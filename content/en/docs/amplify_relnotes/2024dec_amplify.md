### Marketplace updates for December 4, 2024

* **Tiered Plan Quota Limits**

  (PRODUCT FOUNDRY, ENHANCEMENT)<br />
  This feature enables users to enforce specific unit quantity limits per **day, week, or month**, regardless of the tiered pricing structure applied to the total usage during a billing cycle. Providers can ensure consumers stay within defined usage lkimits on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, by capping usage at predefined thresholds.
  
  **Limitation**<br />
  Currently, quota limits **cannot be enforced on a per-minute or per-hour basis**. This limitation will be addressed in a future release to provide even finer granularity for usage controls.
