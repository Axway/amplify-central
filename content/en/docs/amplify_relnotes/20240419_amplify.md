### Axway Agent SDK

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Enhancements for Agent SDK

* **Data models updates** - The Agent SDK has had the data models enhanced to support Embedded Azure, Embedded Apigee X and SwaggerHub agents.
* **Audit Logs** - The Agent SDK has been enhanced with the addition of two additional audit logs.
    * A Metric audit log has been added to all traceability agents and enabled by default to track the metric events based off traffic through the gateway.  This metric audit log is used to track the metric events created by the traceability agent and successfully reflected in Ampfliy Business Insight.  Any errors in communication of the metric will be recorded in this audit log as well.  
    *For the Axway API Management Gateway, the traceability agent has an additional Transaction Audit log to track the correlation IDs of each transaction the agent has seen and recorded.

For more details, refer to [Understand the Traceability Agent audit logs](/docs/connect_manage_environ/connected_agent_common_reference/traceability_audit_logs/).

#### Bug fixes for Agent SDK

There are no known bug fixes in this release.

#### Known issues for Agent SDK

There are no known limitations in this release.

### On-premise agents

All the On-premise Agents were affected by changes to the Agent SDK.

#### Axway API Management Gateway Agent

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

##### Enhancements for Axway API Management Gateway Agent

* **Transaction Audit Log** - The Traceability Agent has added a Transaction Audit log to track the correlation IDs of each transaction the agent has seen and recorded. This audit log can be used to reconcile transactions seen versus communicated to the Amplify platform.
For more details, refer to [Understand the Traceability Agent audit logs](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/amplify-central/page/docs/connect_manage_environ/connected_agent_common_reference/traceability_audit_logs/).

##### Bug fixes for Axway API Management Gateway Agent

* **Null Pointer Exception** - A fix was made to a null pointer exception on startup of the Traceability Agent.
* **Helm Chart fix** - A helm chart fix was made to handle the upgrade of the Traceability Agent when a stateful set is used.
    * K8s Kind: Changes have been made for helm chart deployments of the TA agent and care should be taken when upgrading the chart. The agent chart now utilizes a DaemonSet kind rather than Deployment. This includes an additional [nodeSelector](https://multinode-kubernetes-cluster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/08-k8s-daemonsets.html) set in the chart that limits the agent to running on a node with the `traceability-agent` label set to `true`. The nodeSelector can be overridden in the chart but only one Traceability Agent should run and the node which the events  volume is hosted  should match. This will ensure the agent is ran on a single node and allow for easier upgrades of the helm chart in the future.

    Example command to add a label to the node:

    ```
    kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> traceability-agent=true
    ```

    * Data Volume: The data volume is no longer a persistent volume and has been changed to a hostPath on the node in which the agent will run. The helm chart sill take care of migrating the data directory contents from the persistent volume to the new hostPath.

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Product Foundry

* **Resource count when assigning an asset to a product is removed** - The asset resource count depends on the asset version that is assigned to a product version. Until we know which version is used, it is not possible to give an accurate value. For this reason, we removed the resource count from the column tables when assigning asset to product or when viewing which asset are already assigned. We also removed the selection of a specific asset release as it is more meaningful to use the latest asset release and to stay on that for the product.

Refer to [Advanced Search result documentation](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/searching#advanced-search-result-page).
* **Custom billing integration** - A new Vendor option is available regarding the billing integration. This option enable you integrate with any billing system you have in case our native integration with Stripe is not your preferred choice. More details are available [here](/docs/integrate_with_central/custom_billing).

#### Bug fixes for Marketplace

* **Max Resources in Plan Creation is set to 20** - The limit of 20 resources per plan has been increased to 50.
* **UI - Product release type unknown if there are over 20 releases** - In cases where there were more than 20 product releases, some product release information was missing because of the paginated query. Now, all information is available regardless of the number of releases.
* **Provider cannot provide the custom release version** - When using the product wizard to create a product, the option to set a custom version is now available when you decide to activate the product at the end of its creation.

### Unified Catalog announcements

The statistics related to Unified Catalog have been turned off in preparation of the deprecation of the Unified Catalog feature. Users can no longer see how many times a Unified Catalog item has been viewed (from the list and the catalog item details views).

A migration script to move to Marketplace is available on [Axway GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-migration).

A deprecation banner is visible from the Unified Catalog informing of the deprecation. The banner adapt itself based on the role of the user: consumer VS provider.
