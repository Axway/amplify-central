#### Axway API Management Gateway

The Axway API Management agents have been updated with the Axway Agent SDK. There are no new features or enhancements in this release.

#### Bug fixes for Axway API Management Gateway

* **OPTIONS method transaction events included** - The Traceability Agent has been updated to include transaction events which use the OPTION method.
* **Deprecated API handling** - The Discovery Agent was discovering a deprecated API and only removing the API when both the frontend/backend API were deleted.  A fix was made to no longer include a deprecated API when a new Agent is deployed. In addition, when an API is deprecated, the credential request definition and access request definition are no longer configured for the asset associated with the API instance.

* **Duplicate APIs discovered** - The Discovery Agent has been fixed to not discover the same API again.  The current healthcheck was reusing the discovery process as part of checking connectivity to the Azure API Management plane.  A separate function is now handling the verification of connectivity to the Azure API Management plane (that does not include any discovery of APIs).
