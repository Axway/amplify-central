{{< alert title="Warning" color="warning" >}}The behavior is a breaking change from the previous category visibility API. The visibility object (`CategoryVisibility`) is now separated from the category object to handle the Marketplace specific. See [API definition](https://apicentral.axway.com/apis/docs).{{< /alert >}}

#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **Product access specific rights raise an error when no owner is set** - Now, when a Catalog Manager attempts to enforce access rights, the Product Owner is automatically assigned to the team the user logged in under. Central Admin still cannot set an owner but can set read/write access to a specific team.
* **Pagination issue in the category list view and plan list view** - Previously, the user could not navigate to other list pages using the pagination controller, resulting in the user seeing the records displayed on the first page. Now, they can use the pagination controller to jump to any page.
* **Free plan quota not created with a default value** - Now, the default limit value 1 is considered and correctly creates the plan quota.

#### Known issues for Product Foundry

* **Publish from Service Registry to the Marketplace** - The image from the API Service is used as a reference for the asset and the product, but it is not displayed in the Marketplace.
