* **Deprecate a plan and migrate corresponding subscriptions to a new plan** - A provider can deprecate an active plan in favor of a new one. When doing this operation, existing associated subscriptions can be moved to the new plan. This enables consumers to continue using the corresponding API services. Note that there could be a period of time that the API service access is disrupted, as everything is event based and the Discovery Agent must process the new plan information to apply the corresponding changes to the data plane.
* **Multi-role alignment** - Multiple team roles for a user can now be selected in the Product Foundry UI.
* **Unified Catalog and entitlement** - The Unified Catalog screens are now visible only when the Unified Catalog entitlement is set to Yes.
* **Edit product plan tags and attributes** - Tags and attributes for product plans can now be viewed and edited in the Product Foundry UI.

#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **The Central / Marketplace page loads continuously due to the consumer + subscriber roles** - The combination of these roles prevented the Product Foundry UI from loading.
* **A platform consumer cannot access the Amplify menu options** - A platform user that did not have an assigned team role could not access the platform menus and were stuck in the Product Foundry or Marketplace.
* **Long product names are not displayed correctly** - When releasing a product, a long product name did not correctly display. Now the product name is visible and truncated if reaching the end of the screen.
* **Race condition in API Server APIs when deleting objects** - A race condition was caused when a delete event and an update event were simultaneously sent in the system.

#### Known issues for Product Foundry

There are no known limitations in this release.
