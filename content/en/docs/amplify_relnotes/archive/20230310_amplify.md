### Product Foundry

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Product Foundry

* **Product details screen re-organization** - To get clarity of what belongs to the product and what belongs to the product versions, a new **Version** tab containing all product versions is now available in the product details page. This tab is used to manipulate product versions; whereas, the other tabs are used to manipulate product information. Two other new tabs have been introduced: **Categories** where Catalog Manager can see all the categories assigned to the product, and **Tags & Attributes**`** where the specific information is displayed.
* **Unpublish product from Marketplace** - Similar to the *publish product to marketplace* action, it is now possible for a Catalog Manager to *unpublish a product from one marketplace*. This action is not allowed if there are still active subscription in the marketplace.
* **Product Category in multiple Marketplaces context** - With the introduction of multiple Marketplaces, it is now possible to use a category in one or more Marketplace. The category can be featured in a specific Marketplace. Existing Product Categories are migrated and available in all Marketplaces.

{{< alert title="Caution" color="danger" >}}The behavior is a breaking change from the previous category visibility API. The visibility object (`CategoryVisibility`) is now separated from the category object to specifically handle the Marketplace. See [API definition](https://apicentral.axway.com/apis/docs).{{< /alert >}}

#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **Failure when not selecting any owner for a product if the user is team restricted** - Previously, when creating/updating a product, if the owner was not set in the Access Rights section, an error was raised. Now, the owner is automatically set with the team when the current user is performing the modification. If a Central Admin is doing the modification, the owner can be set at the same time as other rights (Read only / Write).

#### Known issues for Product Foundry

* **Publish from Service Registry to the Marketplace** - The image from the API service is used as a reference for the asset and the product, but it is not displayed in the Marketplace.
