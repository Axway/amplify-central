#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **Redirected to wrong page after creating a product plan** - After creating a product plan, the user was previously redirected to the first tab of the product details instead of the Plans tab. Now, the user is redirected to the Plans tab to view the plan definition.
* **Product plan created with wrong status** - Previously, a wrong status was displayed after a plan was created. Now, a refresh of the screen is performed automatically to enable fetching the right status after a plan is created. The refresh action is performed three times with a delay of two seconds between each tentative.
* **Wrong Marketplace publication status** - With the multi-marketplace, the product publication status was not accurate. Now, the product publication status will be PUBLISHED as soon as the product is published in the Marketplace(s). Otherwise, the status will remain UNPUBLISHED.
* **The publication of a product fails when including plan in invalid state** - The publication screen has been enriched to prevent the user from activating an invalid plan during the product publication process. In addition, when there are no valid plans to activate when publishing a product, the user will see a message with the number of plans already activated.
* **Category deletion popup enrichment** - The delete category confirmation popup now displays the list of categories to be deleted.
