### Marketplace updates for June 6, 2025

* **Delete archived product release**

  (PROVIDER EXPERIENCE, ASSET CATALOG, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  To help maintain a clean and organized product release history, users can now delete archived product releases. This action can be performed via the ellipsis menu on the specific product release. Use this feature to remove outdated or unnecessary archived releases once they are no longer needed.

### Marketplace bug fixes for June 6, 2025

| Case ID | Internal ID | Description |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| | APIGOV-30512 | **Issue**: Attempting to duplicate a plan with a name of 350 chars causes a 400 error <br/>**Resolution**: When a plan was duplicated, the system added "-copy" to the name, which would have exceeded the maximum allowed length if the original plan name was already at the 350-character limit. To avoid this, we now generate a new name automatically. |
| | APIGOV-30216 | **Issue**: [Central UI] Resources, like product/asset, logical names validation uses a different pattern then what the backend enforces <br/>**Resolution**: The validation pattern has been aligned between the UI and the backend. |
| | APIGOV-30059 | **Issue**: Fix inconsistent field lengths in UI vs what is allowed via API calls <br/>**Resolution**: Now, check field length from UI and backend model are aligned. |
