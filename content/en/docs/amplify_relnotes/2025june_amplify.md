|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| | APIGOV-30512 | **Issue**: Attempting to duplicate a plan with a name of 350 chars causes a 400 error <br/>**Resolution**: When a plan was duplicated, the system added "-copy" to the name, which would have exceeded the maximum allowed length if the original plan name was already at the 350-character limit. To avoid this, we now generate a new name automatically. |
| | APIGOV-30216 | **Issue**: [Central UI] Resources, like product/asset, logical names validation uses a different pattern then what the backend enforces <br/>**Resolution**: The validation pattern has been aligned between the UI and the backend. |
