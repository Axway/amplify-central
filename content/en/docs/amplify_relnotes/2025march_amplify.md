### Agents updates for March 21, 2025

* **External custom Credential Request Provisioning with standard OAuth**
  
  (APIM DISCOVERY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Axway API Manager Discovery Agent now allows overriding the standard OAuth Credential Request Type with a custom Credential Request Definition. The update is included in APIM Discovery Agent Agent version 1.2.18 and later. It includes:
    * **Override default CRD**: Users can define and implement their own custom CRD instead of relying on the default definition provided by the agent.
    * **Ignore automatic credential provisioning**: The agent will automatically bypass the default credential provisioning in the API Manager for standard OAuth security type. Users must manage the entire provisioning process externally.

* **WSO2 - API Key support**
  
  (WSO2 DISCOVERY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The WSO2 Discovery Agent now supports API Key provisioning. This allows consumers to generate API Key credentials directly from the Marketplace for APIs managed in WSO2. The update is available in WSO2 Agent version **1.0.2** and later.
  
* **New agent versions available**
