* **Swap featured categories** - When the maximum number of featured categories are reached, providers can easily swap an existing featured category with another one. This will enable them to stay on the preview screen and complete their tasks, without having to navigate back and forth between categories.

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Marketplace

* **Consumer credential management** - This new capability enables consumers to rotate credentials to stay complaint with their security policies:

    * Consumers can view the remaining validity period of issued credentials.
    * Consumer can choose to renew credentials that are about to expire or have expired.
    * Consumers can choose to suspend credentials if they suspect the credentials are corrupted.

* **Search feature on the Marketplace Homepage** - A search bar has been added to the Marketplace Homepage banner, which allows consumers to search products by title or description.
* **Subscription enhancements**:

    * The subscription name no longer displays on the Subscribe side panel. By default, the subscription name contains the name of the product and the name of the selected plan (i.e., Healthcare APIs - Basic Plan).
    * A **Request access** button has been added to the screen to direct the user to request access (if the subscription was automatically approved).
    * A tooltip has been added to the **Owning Team** field to inform the user that an owning team must be selected when they are a member in multiple teams.

#### Bug fixes for Marketplace

* **Subscription and applications do not have the same owner** - Previously, when a consumer requested access to a resource and selected a subscription with a different owner than the application, the request ended up in an error. Now, the subscriptions and applications drop-down lists display only the items that have the same owner.

#### Known issues for Marketplace

There are no known limitations in this release.
