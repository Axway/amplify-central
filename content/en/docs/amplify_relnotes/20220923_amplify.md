* **Ownership was set at the asset version level**: Prior to this fix, the owner was assinged to asset versions, which resulted in different versions of assets to have different owners. Now the owership is assigned to the asset and not to the asset versions. All versions will show the same asset owner.

### Product Foundry

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Product Foundry

* **Provider credential management** - Providers can now view the validity period of a consumer issued credential and act upon it. They can renew, delete or suspend a credential. This will allow providers to stay on control of credentials that might be violating their security policy or pose any risks to their services.
* **Subscription approver role** - A new team role has been introduced which gives the user permissions to manage subscriptions and access requests to products owned by the team they are a member of.
* **Swap featured categories** - When the maximum number of featured categories are reached, providers can easily swap an exiting featured category with another one. This will enable them to stay on the preview screen and complete their tasks, without having to navigate back and forth between different categories.

#### Bug fixes for Product Foundry

* **Teams names in the filter are not sorted alphabetically**: Team names are no displayed in alphabetical order in the **Filter by Owning Team**.

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Marketplace

* **Consumer credential management** - Consumers can view the remaining validity period of an issue credential, choose to renew credentials that are about to expire or expired. In addition, they can choose to suspend a credential, if they suspect their credential was corrupted. This new capability enables consumers to rotate credentials and stay complaint with their security policies.
* **Search feature on the Marketplace Homepage** - A search bar has been added to the Marketplace Homepage banner, which allows consumers to search products by title or description.
* **Subscription enhancements**- Subscription name is no longer displayed on the Subscribe side planel. By default, the subscription name will contain the name of the product and the name of the selected plan (i.e Healthcare APIs - Basic Plan). In addition, a **Request access** button has been added to the screen to direct user to request access, if the subscription was automatically approved. An info descriptive text has been added to the Owning Team field, to describe the user that an owning team must be selected when they are member in multiple teams.

#### Bug fixes for Marketplace

* **Subscription and applications not having same owner** - When a consumer used to request access to a resource and select a subscription with a different owner than the application, the request would end up in an error. After the fix, the subscriptions and applications drop-down show only the items that have the same owner.
