### Unified Catalog announcements

A migration script to move to Marketplace is available on [Axway GitHub](https://github.com/Axway/unified-catalog-migration).

A deprecation banner is visible from the Unified Catalog informing of the deprecation. The banner adapts itself based on the role of the user: consumer VS provider.
