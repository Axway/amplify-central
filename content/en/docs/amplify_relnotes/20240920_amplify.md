### Axway Agent SDK

The Agent SDK was updated to address security fixes in this release. The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Enhancements for Agent SDK

* **Transaction Sampling Percentage** - The sampling rate for the SaaS Agent configuration has been updated to have the default sampling rate set to zero percent and no sampling of transactions errors. This will ensure that both the SaaS and on-prem agents work the same.
* **Credential Request Method available for selection** - There is a new setting available in the on-prem agent configuration that provides a toggle for displaying or hiding specific options within the OAuth credential Type dropdown menu on the *Request Credential* screen in the Marketplace. See [Show / Hide OAuth Credential Type](/docs/connect_manage_environ/marketplace_provisioning/#show--hide-the-values-in-the-credential-request-oauth-type-dropdown-menu).

#### Feature updates for Product Foundry

* **New product plan look and feel** - The *Create product plan* wizard screen has a fresh look and feel. The UI has been redesigned for improved usability and better visualization of the billing configuration vs. quota configuration. This update includes a new *Billing Configuration* screen where users can set up the pricing model and the subscription term length, and a separated *Quotas* screen where entitled quotas for APIs are configured. See [Plan billing option](/docs/manage_product_foundry/manage_product_plans/#product-plan-type-and-consumption-cost).
* **Automatically cancel subscription with past due invoices** - A new setting has been added to configure whether subscriptions with past-due invoices should be automatically canceled. By enabling auto-cancellation, users with past due invoices are prevented from continuing to use your services, reducing the administrative burden of manually managing overdue subscriptions and minimizing revenue loss.

## Consumer experience

### Marketplace

The following enhancements and bug fixes are available in this release.

#### Feature updates for Marketplace

* **Automatically cancel subscriptions having past due invoices** - A new setting has been added to configure whether subscriptions with past-due invoices should be automatically canceled. When the Marketplace receives a past due invoice event from the billing system, it checks whether the corresponding plan allows the system to automatically cancel the subscription. If automatic cancellation was configured, the subscription will be cancelled and all associated access/credentials will be deprovision. See [Invoice past due flow](docs/integrate_with_central/custom_billing#invoice-past-due-flow).
