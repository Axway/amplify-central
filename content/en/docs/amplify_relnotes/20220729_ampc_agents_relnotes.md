Traceability and Discovery agents for Amplify Gateway / AWS / Azure / Istio provide better visibility into your multi-type gateway eco system.

## Fixed issues

* **Add issue**. Add text.

## Known limitations

The following limitations exist in this update.

### Amplify Gateway agents

* When an API is renamed in API Manager, Discovery Agent cannot recognize the API name change. This results in the API displaying in Amplify Central with dual entries of both the originally discovered name and the newly changed name.

### Amplify AWS Gateway agents

* Discovery Agent is working with only one AWS Region (the one used when installing the agent).
* Discovery Agent can discover APIs having ANY method only, but consumers cannot subscribe to it from Unified Catalog.
* Discovery Agent does not associate the usage plan and API when a subscriber chooses a usage plan that is not already linked to the chosen API.
* The Usage report is not scalable, as the agent relies on AWS Simple Queue Service and cannot have more than 10 consumers per queue. It is possible to increase the number of workers on the agent side.

### Amplify Azure agents

* Discovery Agent does not manage revision and version.
* Discovery Agent does not remove the API Service and the Catalog item when the Azure API is removed.

### Amplify Istio agents

* Discovery Agent requires manual setup to report APIs correctly.
