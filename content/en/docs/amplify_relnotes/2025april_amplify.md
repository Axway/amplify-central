## April 9, 2025

New features, enhancements, and bug fixes for the March 21 update.

### Agents updates for April 9, 2025

* **Traceable API Security - Conformance Analysis support**
  
  (TRACEABLE API SECURITY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Traceable on-premise API Seccurity Agent uploads Managed API specifications from Engage to Traceable in order to execute Traceable conformance analysis. This improves the combined value of Engage and Traceable to more accurately identify endpoints with risks, shadow endpoints, and orphan endpoints.  The conformance analysis results are displayed on the Engage Environment details. The update is included in Traceable API Security Agent version 2.0.0 and later.

* **Kong Enterprise - Workspace support**
  (KONG DISCOVERY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Kong Discovery Agent can disover API Services from one or more Kong Enterprise workspaces. The update is included in Kong Discovery Agent version 1.1.17 and later.

* **External Handling of Access Request Definition**
  (APIM DISCOVERY AGENT, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  The Axway API Manager Discovery Agent now allows the enabling/disabling of Access Request Definition provisioning.  When disabled, this allows a customer to customize the handling of an Access Request Definition flow. The update is included in APIM Discovery Agent version 1.2.21 and later.

* **All Traceability Agents - Transaction Sampling**
  (TRACEABILITY AGENTS, ENHANCEMENT)</br>
  All on-premise and SaaS Traceability Agents have been updated for on demand Transaction Sampling initiated from the Engage UI (Topology -> Environments -> Agents). Once initiated from the Engage UI, all trasactions including API errors will be sampled for up to five minutes. The count of API successes or error will still be registered on the API Health screen and we recommend the use of the API Gateway tools to further analyze the transactions. The update is included in all Traceability Agents released after April 7, 2025.

* **New agent versions available**
