The Service Registry allows users to view their API Services (auto-discovered and manually registered) across all environments, so they can facilitate the adoption / reuse of similar API Services in an asset. The Topology view is another way to see the API Services per environment.

## What is a service

A service is a representation of all items related to an API that belongs to an environment. Services can be auto discovered with agents or manually registered in an environment.
