Only the Central Admin users can edit the details of your API Services in manual sync environments with tags, attributes, and categories. This can make the curation and organization of API Service more efficient.

## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that can be assigned to API Services and used to search for services. You can create tags with special characters. For example, _ - & () \ [] and all types of special language characters.

1. Select a service in the *Service Registry* and open it.
2. Click **Edit API Service** on upper right.
3. Click **Tags and Attributes** in side panel and enter the new tag. To remove a tag, click the **X** next to the tag name.

## Add or remove attributes

Attributes are keyword and value pairs that can be assigned to API Services and used to search for services. You can create attributes using both lowercase and uppercase. Examples of useful attributes are state = France and city = Paris.

1. Select a service in the *Service Registry* and open it.
2. Click **Edit API Service** on upper right.
3. Click **Tags and Attributes** in side panel and enter the new attribute and value. To remove an attribute, click the **X** next to the attribute key=value.

Note:  Categories which are created can be assigned to Assets and Products.  They can not be assigned to API Services.
