Only the Central Admin users can edit the details of your API Services with tags, attributes, and categories. This can make the curation and organization of API Service more efficient.

## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that can be assigned to API Services and used to search for services. You can create tags with special characters. For example, _ - & () \ [] and all types of special language characters.

1. Select a service in the *Service Registry* and open it.
2. Click **Edit API Service** on upper right.
3. Click **Tags and Attributes** in side panel and enter the new tag. To remove a tag, click the **X** next to the tag name.

## Add or remove attributes

Attributes are keyword and value pairs that can be assigned to API Services and used to search for services. You can create attributes using both lowercase and uppercase. Examples of useful attributes are state = France and city = Paris.

1. Select a service in the *Service Registry* and open it.
2. Click **Edit API Service** on upper right.
3. Click **Tags and Attributes** in side panel and enter the new attribute and value. To remove an attribute, click the **X** next to the attribute key=value.

## Manage Categories

Searching through an unordered, unorganized list of API Services can be a daunting task when you consider the number of API Services across the environments. However, Central Admin users can create categories to group assets in the Amplify Service Registry to make searching for services more effective and more organized. Examples of categories are Finance and Medicine.

Categories allow for a broader grouping of services into different topics or themes. Categories are created once, and multiple services can be assigned to them. One services can be in multiple categories.

Categories which are created can be assigned to API Services, Assets, and Products.
