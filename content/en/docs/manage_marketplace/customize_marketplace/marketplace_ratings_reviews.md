Customize the Marketplace to enable consumers to rate the product.

## Before you start

You must have Platform Administrator credentials and your organization must have the Public Marketplace entitlement to enable and configure *Marketplace Ratings* content.

Once feedback is given, the rating is visible in the [Marketplace](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/ratings_reviews) and in the [Product Foundry](/docs/manage_product_foundry/foundry_product_ratings_reviews).

## Enable the Marketplace ratings

1. Navigate to *platform.axway.com > Organization > Marketplaces*.
2. Open the desired Marketplace **Settings**.
3. Select **Ratings & reviews**.
4. Switch the toggle to **Enabled** (Disabled by default) to allow consumers to rate the Marketplace products.
