## Before you start

## Objectives

Learn how to enable the Marketplace ratings and reviews so that consumers can give feeback on your digital products. Once feedback is given, the rating and review is visible in the [Marketplace](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/ratings_reviews) and in the [Product Foundry](/docs/manage_product_foundry/foundry_product_ratings_reviews).

6. Select the Moderation Process:
   * **Manual Moderation** - the Catalog Manager owning the product must manually approve the review before it is visible to all users.
