## Browse the marketplace

Consumers can [navigate the Marketplace](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/browse_marketplace) anonymously by navigating to the configured Marketplace URL, e.g., `<http://acme.marketplace.axway.com>`, assuming the Marketplace has been set to be publicly accessible.

As long as the user hasn’t logged in, they can freely explore the published products in the Marketplace, but won’t be able to subscribe or any other actions until they have logged in.

When the consumer is invited to a private Marketplace, consumer credentials are required to log into to the marketplace.

## Find a product

Find the product you need by browsing the paginated product catalog. Use the marketplace filter to refine the search with product name and product description.

Each product can be opened to see their details:

* product documentation
* product resources
* product plans
