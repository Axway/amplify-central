The Console is your personal activity center where you can monitor your team’s key actions in the Marketplace — including subscription activity, application registrations, and the products your team is currently subscribed to.

This screen is organized into three main sections to help you stay on top of your Marketplace activities.

## Subscription Activity

This section shows your product subscriptions organized by approval status (Approved / Pending / Declined).

It displays your seven most recent subscriptions for each approval status.
Click **View All** at the top of the panel to see your complete subscription list.

Under the **Approved** subscription tab, click **Register Application** to request access to Product APIs. This opens the application registration wizard. See [Request Access to an API](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/credential_management#request-access-to-an-api).

## Application Registration Activity

This section displays your application registrations organized by approval status (Approved / Pending / Declined).

It displays your seven most recent application registrations for each approval status.  
Click **View All** at the top of the panel to see your complete application registration list.

Under the **Approved** application registration tab, click **Request credentials** to request credentials. This will open the credential panel. See [Create credential](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/credential_management#create-credentials).

### Subscribed Products

This section displays all products your team has subscribed to.

Each product is displayed as a card showing:

* **Product name** - The name of the subscribed product
* **Product description** - A brief overview of what the product offers
* **Number of subscriptions** - How many subscriptions your team has for this product
* **Number of applications** - Applications associated with this product
* **Version** - The current version of the product
* **Updated Date** - When the product was last updated
* **Register application button** - Quick action to register a new application for this product
