## View the product rating and reviews

A Product's rating and reviews is visible in the *product details* screen, located at the right of the *Overview*, *Resources*, *Document* and *Plans* sections, or in the *Ratings & Reviews* section.

If the product has not been rated, only the **Write a review** button is displayed in the view. This button will be disable if the product's ratings/reviews are restricted.

If ratings and reviews are restricted to product subscription owners, then the **Write a review** button in the *Ratings & Reviews* section is disabled. A tooltip is available that indicates that you must be subscribed to the product to submit reviews. The **Write a review** button is enable once the user's product subscription is approved.

Once a product has been rated, the view displays:

* The average rating, the distribution of the ratings, and the **Write a review** button.
* A list of the existing reviews, including:
    * The user that left the review
    * The date when the review was submitted
    * The rating value represented with star symbols
    * The review title
    * The review comment left by the reviewer (the comment can be truncated). Clicking the review to open the details panel where you can view the entire review comment.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}
A review comment is visible once approved by the product owner, otherwise: <br />Comment value is replaced with: "This review's comment is under validation process" when the review is in pending approval state. <br />Comment value is replaced with: "This review's comment did not meet our community guidelines and has not been published, only your rating is taken into account" when the review is declined by the provider.

Once you submit a review, it will appear slightly different from the other reviews; two icons will diplay at the right:

* **Eye** - to view the details of the review
* **Pen** - to edit the review
