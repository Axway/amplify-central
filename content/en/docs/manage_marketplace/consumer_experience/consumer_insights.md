Get insights about your API consumption in the Marketplace.

Access to the Consumer Insights menu is based on your role and permissions and your organization's subscriptions to the Marketplace. Users must have one of the following [roles](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/platform-management/page/docs/management_guide/organizations/organization_roles_and_features/index.html) to access the API Health dashboards.

From the Marketplace left navigation click **Consumer Insights**. You are directed to the Consumer Insights dashboards within the Marketplace.

## API Health

Click **API Health** to see an aggregated view of your API recent usage. This view is useful for monitoring traffic patterns and successes or failures over time.

The view shows all transactions, successes, client errors, and server errors with the total number, percentage details, and trend (when **Compare to previous period** is selected) in the tiles across the top below the filter options. Click the **Compare to previous period** option to compare the current selected time range to the previous time range. You can compare the current week, month, or year to the previous week, month, or year to understand how your API usage is changing over time.

Each item in the list provides the average, maximum, and minimum duration.

You can filter by subscriptions, products, applications, and APIs. You can choose a wide range of time from minutes to years. You can choose one of the pre-configured time ranges.

The API usage reporting for transactions is not real time and may be delayed by several minutes based on settings selected by your API provider.
