A *Public marketplace* can be browsed by navigating to the configured Marketplace URL, for example: `http://acme.marketplace.axway.com`.

Anonymous consumers can freely explore the published products in the Marketplace, but wonâ€™t have the ability to subscribe, or any other actions, until they have logged in.

A *Private marketplace* can be browsed by navigating to the configured Marketplace URL, for example: `http://acme.marketplace.axway.com`. Consumers are redirected to a login screen and asked to enter their Platform credentials.

There are two ways of signing up in the Marketplace:

* A provider invited you into their organization
* Consumers can self register to the Marketplace and manage their [organization, users and teams](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/consumer_organization)

Once consumers are logged in, they can browse products, subscribe to products, request access and credentials for resource they wants to use, and get [insight](/docs/get_actionable_insights/consumer_insights/) into their API consumption.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Because a consumer can belong to multiple organizations, it is preferable to configure the user account to always ask for the organization. Refer to Platform home > Account > Settings > Org login Rule : Always ask for Org option{{< /alert >}}
