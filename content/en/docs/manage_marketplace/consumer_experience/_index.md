Consumers can navigate the marketplace anonymously by navigating to the configured Marketplace URL (example: http://acme.marketplace.axway.com), assuming the Marketplace has been set to be publicly accessible in the Marketplace Settings. 

As long as a user hasn’t logged in, they can freely explore the published products in the Marketplace, but won’t have the ability to subscribe, or any other actions, until they have logged in.

Once a consumer logs into a private Marketplace using their platform credentials, they can browse products, subscribe to a product, request access and credentials for a particular resource they wants to use, and get [insight](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/consumer_insights/) into their API consumption.
