Learn how to use the Activity Dashboard.

## What is the Activity Dashboard?

The Activity Dashboard is your personal command center where you can view and manage all your marketplace activities in one convenient location. Here you'll find:

* Your subscription status and history
* Your application registration details
* All products you've subscribed to

### Empty Activity Dashboard

In case, you don't have any subscription or application registration yet, the tab will be replaced with an empty section having only 1 button:

* **View products** to find a suitable product to subscribe to.
* **View applications** to find or create an application.

### Understanding Status Counts

At the top of each activity panel, you'll see the total count for each status tab. These numbers give you a quick overview of:

* **Subscription Activity**: Total approved, pending, and cancelled subscriptions
* **Application Registration Activity**: Total approved, pending, and rejected application registrations

This helps you quickly assess your marketplace activity at a glance.
