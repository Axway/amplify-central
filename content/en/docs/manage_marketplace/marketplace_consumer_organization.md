Providers can configure one or more consumer organizations that are independently managed from their own provider organization.

## Before you start

You must have platform Administrator credentials.

## Objectives

Understand what is a consumer organization and learn how to enable/disable a Marketplace consumer organization.

## What is a consumer organization?

When you want to share your marketplace with multiple external entities (partners / subsidiaries ...) to your company, it becomes complex to manage all the users and associated teams especially when your Marketplace is connected to an IDP.

To facilitate that, it is possible to delegate this user management using one or more consumer organizations. A consumer organization is a place where consumers will be able to self-organize their users and teams independently from your provider organization.

Refer to [Consumer organization management](/docs/manage_marketplace/consumer_experience/consumer_organization)

## View the Marketplace consumer organization

From platform.axway.con > Marketplace > navigate to **Consumer Orgs** page.

This page displays all the consumer organization available with their number of teams and users. A provider does not have the rights to add teams or users into a consumer organization. The only actions they are allowed to perform is enable/disable organizations.

Only an enabled organization allows users to connect to the Marketplace. Disable a consumer organization to stop users registered in that organization from connecting to the Marketplace.

## Enable and disable a consumer organization

Select an active organization you want to disable and click the ellipsis menu **Disable**. A confirmation popup is displayed. Click **Disable** to trigger the action and disable the organization. Click **Cancel** to cancel the action and the organization continues to be in an enabled state. In a disabled state, no users from this organization can connect to the Marketplace.

To re-enable an organization, find the appropriate organization and select the corresponding ellipsis menu **Enable**. A confirmation popup is displayed. Click **Enable** to trigger the action and the organization will be re-enable. Click **Cancel** to cancel the action and the organization continues to be in a Disabled state.
