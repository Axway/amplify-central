Make a product available for consumption by subscribers. A set of business capabilities is published into the Marketplace, which is the storefront into all products exposed for discovery and consumption by internal and / or external consumers.

## Before you start

Create a valid product by bundling assets that solve a business case, create comprehensive product user documentation, and define a subscription plan for your product. For information, see [Manage your Product Foundry](/docs/manage_product_foundry/).

## Objectives

Learn how to publish the product to the Marketplace.

2. Select **All Products**. The product list view is displayed.
3. Find the product you want to publish and click the Marketplace icon, located at the bottom right corner, to start the publication process. A popup displays the current product version that will be visible from the Marketplace, as well as the defined plans.
4. Select the plan(s) you want activated at the same time as the publication.
