The Marketplace is the storefront into all products exposed for discovery and consumption by internal and/or external consumers.

Providers can publish to the Marketplace a curated set of business capabilities (products) that target different needs, use cases, and audiences.

Consumers can explore the Marketplace to find products that address their needs, then subscribe and build their application.

## Marketplace features

**External/public access** - Providers can expand their consumer exposure and market footprint by targeting new segments of consumers with open/public access to their product offerings. Unauthenticated users can browse product offerings and product documentation in the catalog before enrolling. However, an account registration is required to subscribe and consume products within the Marketplace.  

**Custom branding** - Providers can customize the look and feel of the Marketplace to match each organization's preference and branding style. This enables providers to create a curated experience for both internal and external consumers that access their products within the Marketplace.

**Extended product documentation** - Providers can create comprehensive product documentation via markdown format, providing a uniform experience for all Marketplace content.
