## What is the Axway Central CLI

The Axway Central CLI is a package for managing Amplify Central resources with a DevOps approach to API Management. This is an external CLI add-on package to the Axway CLI. For more information, see [Axway CLI](https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axwaycli-open-docs/page/docs/index.html).

## How does the Axway Central CLI support a DevOps approach

The Axway Central CLI enables DevOps to perform API Management tasks on Amplify Central, such as the delivery of new API service to your customers. A DevOps Amplify Central supports your DevOps processes by providing an API and a CLI for you to automate your configuration and deployments.

In the case of the Axway SaaS Gateway, you can create API proxies and deploy them to runtime groups using the Axway Central CLI. You can test the API proxies and view the traffic monitoring results through the Amplify Central UI.

You can also create representations of your environments and API services, which are not synchronized with Amplify Central, using the Axway Central CLI. These are shown as Manual Sync in Amplify Central and these API Services can be published to the Unified Catalog for your customers to consume.

This DevOps-friendly approach can be accomplished using scripts of CLI commands with configuration files in YAML or JSON format. As a result, you can automate, deploy, and integrate services faster into your DevOps lifecycle process.
