## Before you start

* You understand the concepts involved in the [API Server](/docs/integrate_with_central/api_server/).
* You know how to use [Amplify Central CLI](/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central)

## Objectives

Learn with a step by step adventure how to create and manipulate Amplify Enterprise Marketplace concepts: from the environment to the Marketplace.

## scenario description

The scenario is the following: we have an API Service that will move from Dev, QA to Production stage. An asset will embed that API Service and then a Product will be built on top of the Asset. To help understanding all phases, the Asset and Product will use the Manual Release procedure.

The product and his various components (category, documentation, stage, plan) will be internationalized using two languages: US (default) and FR. So that it can be displayed differently based on the Marketplace language settings.

The scenario is available here for [download](/static/samples/e2e/e2e.zip)

The zip structure is the following:

* folder **1.init**: contains Stage, Environment, Category, SubscriptionRequestDefinition, AccessRequestDefinition and CredentialRequestDefinition

    * *J0-6-ard-scopes-multi-language.json*: the application registration additional data asked when consumer wants to link an API to an Application.
    * *J0-7-crd-externalCredential-multi-language.json*: the credential additional data asked when consumer request for credentials.

All the files are prefixed with a number to determine in which order you should apply them with the CLI: `axway central apply -f file.json`.

{{< alert title="Stage visibility" color="primary" >}}
The file *J0-2-stage-visibility.json* needs to be updated with the Marketplace name before applying it.

You can find the Marketplace name using this CLI command: `axway central get marketplace`.

Grab the name and replace `_MKT_NAME_GOES_HERE_` inside the file with the appropriate name you want. Save it and apply it as the other files. Now, the stages should be visible in the Marketplace you selected.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Category visibility" color="primary" >}}
The file *J0-5-category-visibility.json* needs to be updated with the Marketplace name before applying it.

You can find the Marketplace name using this CLI command: `axway central get marketplace`.

Grab the name and replace `_MKT_NAME_GOES_HERE_` inside the file with the appropriate name you want. Save it and apply it as the other files. Now, the category should be visible in the Marketplace you selected.
{{< /alert >}}

{{< alert title="Marketplace publication" color="primary" >}}
The file *J1-11-productPublish.json* needs to be updated with the Marketplace name before applying it.

You can find the Marketplace name using this CLI command: `axway central get marketplace`.

Grab the name and replace `_MKT_NAME_GOES_HERE_` inside the file with the appropriate name you want. Save it and apply it as the other files. Now, your product should be visible in the Marketplace you selected.
{{< /alert >}}

## Tips

How can I see the language information from the objects using the CLI?

```cmd
axway central get {objectType} {objectName} --language=* -o json
```

Applying that to our sample:

```cmd
axway central get product customer-data -o json --language=*
```

will produce (some part are voluntary removed for clarity):

```json
{
    "group": "catalog",
    "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
    "kind": "Product",
    "name": "customer-data",
    "title": "Customner Data",
    ...
    "spec": {

            "category-marketing"
        ],
        "description": "That product does this and that..."
    },
