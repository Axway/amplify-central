Update page to use the CLI and return the i18 information and its constraint to help wih translation

Use Axway Central CLI basic commands for creating, fetching, updating, and deleting various Axway API Server assets. Each command is followed by a brief description, an explanation of the proper command syntax, including command arguments and options, along with example syntax for various use cases.

### The accessibility of resources

Resources can be *scoped* or *unscoped*.

The scope refers to the lifetime and accessibility of a resource. Unscoped resource are top-level resources which act as groups. Scoped resource are grouped under unscoped resources. For example, an API service resource is scoped to a corresponding environment resource. When that environment is deleted, the scoped API service resource (as well as any other scoped resource belonging to it) will also be deleted. Versus deleting the API service resource, which will only delete that one resource.

If the desired resource type is scoped, you must specify the scope name by providing the `-s, --scope <name>` flag.

You can search for more than one resource if you use comma-separated resources in a command. The search for multiple resources will display multiple result tables, one result table for each resource you fetch.

To see the list of all available resources from Enterprise Marketplace, including information about whether those resources are scoped or unscoped, run:

```bash
axway central get
```

## get

This command lists one or more resources. It also prints a table of the most important information about an specified resource.

The following table describes the usage, options, and arguments for the `get` command:

|Usage                                                          |                             |

### Fetching, Filtering and Querying

You can fetch resources by either Resource, Short Name, or the specific Resource Name.

You can "simple filter" resources by title, tag, and attribute (see examples below). These simple filters can be used independently or in combination (i.e., you can filter by title AND tag AND attribute). However, they only support -singular- filters; you can only filter by *one* tag, *one* title, or *one* attribute at a time.

For more complex filtering and fetching (e.g., filtering by *multiple* tags, titles, attributes, and other filters), you can also query for resources that match [RSQL-formatted](https://github.com/jirutka/rsql-parser#grammar-and-semantic) query parameters you pass in. See the linked documentation for an example of RSQL query syntax, and the "get examples" below for sample usage.

{{< alert title="Note" color="primary" >}}Using the --query flag will override any --title, --tag or --attribute flags you use.{{< /alert >}}

The following examples show how to use the `get` command:

```bash
# To get all environments:
axway central get envs

# To get all environments in YAML format:
axway central get environments -o yaml

# To get environment by resource, or common name (for example, 'myenv') in JSON format:
axway central get env myenv -o json

# To get all webhooks:
axway central get webhooks

# To get all webhooks by short name:
axway central get webh

# To get all webhooks and API services by short name:
axway central get webh, apis

# To get all environments and API services:
axway central get envs, apisvc

# To get an environment and an API service, which matches a resource in a specified scope in JSON format. In the following example, 'env1' is scope, and it is required after the `-s` flag):
axway central get env,apisvc commonname -s env1 -o json

# To get apiservice with name "testsvc" in the scope "Environment" with name "testenv"
axway central get apisvc testsvc -s Environment/testenv
```

The following example shows how to use the get command to fetch the internationalization information for a resource using the --language argument:

```bash
# To get a product with name "test-product" with all the available language translations in JSON format
axway central get products test-product --language="*" -o json
```

The sample output for the 'get' command with '--language="*"' argument is as follows:

```json

}

```

```bash
# To get a product with name "test-product" with French language translation if available in YAML format
axway central get products test-product --language="fr-fr" -o yaml

# To get a product with name "test-product" with German language translation if available in YAML format
axway central get products test-product --language="de-de" -o yaml

# To get a product with name "test-product" with US English language translation if available in YAML format
axway central get products test-product --language="en-us" -o yaml

# To get a product with name "test-product" with Portugal language translation if available in YAML format
axway central get products test-product --language="pt-br" -o yaml
```

The following example shows how to use the get command to fetch just the internationalization information to facilitate a translation using the --languageDefinition argument:

```bash
# To get a stage with name "demo-stage" with the French language translation in JSON format
axway central get stages demo-stage --languageDefinition="fr-fr" -o json
```

The sample output for the 'get' command with '--languageDefinition="fr-fr"' argument is as follows:

```json

    "group": "catalog",
    "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
    "kind": "Stage",

                    "resource": {
                        "schema": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "maxLength": 350,
                            "description": "The resource title."
                        },
                        "value": "Test/QA stage"
                    }
                }

                            "type": "string",
                            "description": "description of the stage",
                            "maxLength": 350
                        },
                        "value": "Groups Assets available in QA"
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

```bash
# To get a stage with name "demo-stage" with the US English language translation in JSON format
axway central get stages demo-stage --languageDefinition="en-us" -o json

# To get a stage with name "demo-stage" with the German language translation in JSON format
axway central get stages demo-stage --languageDefinition="de-de" -o json

# To get a stage with name "demo-stage" with the Portugese language translation in JSON format
axway central get stages demo-stage --languageDefinition="pt-br" -o json
```

The following examples show how to use the get command with RSQL queries using the -q flag:

```bash
# To get assets with titles that start with "a"
axway central get assets -q "title==a*"

# To get assets with titles that start with a or i
axway central get assets -q "title==a* or title==i*"

# To get assets with tags that match tag1 or tag2
axway central get assets -q "tags=in=(tag1,tag2)"

# To get assets with logical names that start with 'i'
axway central get assets -q "name==i*"

# To get assets whose logical names start with 'a' OR 'i'
axway central get assets -q "name==a* or name==i*"

# To get assets whose logical names start with 'i' AND are tagged with 'test123'
axway central get assets -q "name=='i*';tags==test123"

# To get assets whose logical names start with 'i' or 'a' AND are tagged with 'test' or 'prod'
axway central get assets -q "name=='i*' or name=='a*';tags=in=(test,prod)"
```

The following examples show how to use the get command with simple filters:

```bash
# To get assets and filter the list to assets that have a specific title "test123"
axway central get assets --title test123

# To get assets and filter the list to assets that have a specific tag "tag1"
axway central get assets --tag tag1

# To get assets and filter the list to assets that have a specific attribute "location=arizona"
axway central get assets --attribute location=arizona

# To get assets and filter the list with a combination of title, tag and attribute filters
axway central get assets --title test123 --tag tag1 --attribute location=arizona

# To get environments owned by a specific team
axway central get env --team <name|guid>

# To get API services owned by a specific team or implicitly owned by the environments owning team
axway central get apis --team <name|guid>

# To get API services that are not owned by a team
axway central get apis --no-owner
```

The following examples show how to use the `apply` command:

```bash
# create multiple resources from file
axway central apply -f ./some/folder/resources.yaml

# create multiple resources from file and output results in YAML format
axway central apply -f ./some/folder/resources.json -o yaml
```

The following examples show how to use the `apply` command to apply just the language translation requested using '--language' argument :

```bash
# apply french language translation to the resource from file if the translation exists
axway central apply -f ./some/folder/lang-resources.json --language="fr-fr"

# apply german and portugese translation to the resource from file if the translations eixts and output results in YAML format
axway central apply -f ./some/folder/lang-resources.json --language="de-de,pt-br,en-us" -o yaml
```

The 'lang-resources.json' file contents are as follows :
