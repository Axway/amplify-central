This topic explains how to configure webhooks to receive notifications from Amplify Central.

## Before you start

* You understand the concepts involved in the [API Server](/docs/integrate_with_central/api_server/).

## Objectives

Learn how to create and configure webhooks in Amplify Central, as well as the event structure that corresponds to a set of actions, such as catalog asset updated and new subscription request submitted.

## Webhooks

A webhook is an HTTP callback: an HTTP POST that occurs when something happens. Webhooks are used to automatically receive notifications that something happened to any resources on the API Server. For example, when a new asset is discovered in a environment or when an item is subscribed to in the Marketplace. Webhooks allow you to configure integrations on resources in Amplify Central. When one of those events is triggered, Amplify Central sends an HTTP POST payload to the URL configured in the webhook. Once you receive an event on your server, you can process and act on it as needed.

You can use webhooks to define a custom approval flow, set up a policy to validate discovered APIs or deploy to your production server.

Each event payload that your webhook server receives is structured similar to the example below, which is for when a new API is discovered in an environment:

```json
{
    "id": "af7cd036-e57a-4275-9ab3-2bf1d04757ce",
    "time": "2020-09-04T22:41:31.608+0000",
    "version": "v1",
    "product": "AmplifyCentral",
    "correlationId": "b013871b-05ce-4ea2-b4c3-148b702b3e55",

                "kind": "Environment",
                "name": "axway",
                "selfLink": "/management/v1alpha1/environments/axway"
            },

            "instruments",
            "musical"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Anatomy of a webhook event

Each event payload that your webhook server receives is structured similar to the example above which has the following format:

* **id**: a uid for the webhook event.
* **time**: indicates the time when the webhook was triggered by a change in resource.
* **correlationId:** each API request is tagged with an id once it received by Amplify Central. The correlationId is the id of the originating request which updated the system. Note that an API call into Amplify Central may result in a number of changes to resources in Central. For example, consider the result of deleting an environment request which will result in a cascade delete of all the resources and subresources of that environment.
* **organization:** indicates the organization id that the resource belongs to.
* **type:** indicates if this is a create, update or delete event. Supported types: ResourceCreated/ResourceUpdated/ResourceDeleted/SubResourceUpdated.
* **payload:** contains the contents of the resource that changed and resulted in the webhook being triggered.

## Setting up a webhook

To receive webhook event notifications from the API Server, you must complete the following steps:

1. Create a webhook which will be called on a particular event.
2. Create the trigger which will invoke the webhook URL defined in step 1.

### Create a webhook

To receive notifications of events, you must create a webhook that details the server that will receive the notifications. Create the webhook resource in the API Server:

```yaml
group: management
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: Webhook
name: invoke-jira-webhook
title: JIRA approval webhook
metadata:
  scope:
    kind: Environment
    name: azure-apiman-service
spec:
  url: >-
    https://webhook.site/9cb87457-04ad-4db4-830f-2da5dc46e0bb
  enabled: true
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
```

Key fields in the Webhook resource:

* **$name**: webhook unique identifier.
* **$title**: webhook friendly name.
* **$spec.url**: URL of the server that will receive the webhook `POST`requests.
* **$spec.enabled**: when enabled will invoke the webhook.

You can create the webhook resource using the CLI:

```sh
axway central apply -f webhook.yaml
âœ” "Webhook/invoke-jira-webhook" in the scope "Environment/azure-apiman-service" has successfully been updated.
```

### Create the trigger

After the webhook has been created, you must specify when the webhook will be invoked. You can set up a webhook on any resource in Amplify Central by configuring a **Resource hook**. An event will be published on any CRUD operation. When the resource hook trigger conditions match, the resource hook referenced webhooks will be invoked, and an HTTP `POST` payload will be sent to the webhook's URL. For example, the webhook can be invoked when a new API asset is created.

The following are examples of the **Resource Hook** payload.

Monitor all API service revisions in *invoke-jira-webhook* environment:

```json
{
   "group": "management",
   "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
   "kind": "ResourceHook",
   "name": "apiservicerevisions-hook",
   "title": "Monitor API Service Revision changes from 'azure-apiman-service' Environment",
   "spec": {
      "triggers": [
         {
            "group": "management",
            "kind": "APIServiceRevision",
            "name": "*",
            "type": [
               "updated",
               "created",
               "deleted"
            ],
            "scope": {
               "kind": "Environment",
               "name": "azure-apiman-service"
            }
         }
      ],
      "webhooks": [
         "invoke-jira-webhook"
      ]
   }
}
```

Monitor changes on all environment resources:

```json
{
   "group": "management",
   "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
   "kind": "ResourceHook",
   "name": "environments-hook",
   "title": "Monitor all Environment resources",
   "spec": {
      "triggers": [
         {
            "group": "management",
            "kind": "Environment",
            "name": "*",
            "type": [
               "created",
               "updated",
               "deleted"
            ]
         }
      ],
      "webhooks": [
         "invoke-jira-webhook"
      ]
   }
}
```

Monitor changes in a specific environment "azure-apiman-service" and on all its resources:

```json
{
   "group": "management",
   "apiVersion": "v1alpha1",
   "kind": "ResourceHook",
   "name": "environments-hook",
   "title": "Monitor Environment azure-apiman-service and all its resources",
   "spec": {
      "triggers": [
         {
            "group": "management",
            "kind": "Environment",
            "name": "azure-apiman-service",
            "type": [
               "created",
               "updated",
               "deleted"
            ]
         },
         {
            "group": "management",
            "kind": "*",
            "name": "*",
            "type": [
               "created",
               "updated",
               "deleted"
            ],
            "scope": {
               "kind": "Environment",
               "name": "azure-apiman-service"
            }
         }
      ],
      "webhooks": [
         "invoke-jira-webhook"
      ]
   }
}
```

* **$name**: resource hook unique name.
* **$title**: resource hook friendly name.
* **$spec.triggers.group**: value for the group of the resource.
* **$spec.triggers.scope**: resource scope trigger details.
* **$spec.triggers.scope.kind**: the type of the resource. For example, the webhook will be invoked on any events on resources of type **Environment**.
* **$spec.triggers.scope.name**: the name of the resource of the type specified. "*" represents any. When you specify a name, the webhook will be invoked on any resource in the environment with that name.
* **$spec.triggers.kind**: the resource in the scope defined via `$spec.triggers.scope.kind`. "*" represents any. For example, APIService under the **Environment** type. Instead of a wildcard, you can provide specific names to set up a trigger to invoke the webhooks.
* **$spec.triggers.name**: the name of the trigger of the type specified. "*" represents any. When you specify a name, the webhook will be invoked on any resource in the environment with that name.
* **$spec.triggers.type**: the type of the event. Accepted values: **created**, **updated**, **deleted**
* **$spec.webhooks**: a list of webhook names that determine which webhooks will be invoked on matching triggers.

The following is an example of "When resource type of kind `APIService` with any name is created, updated, or deleted in any group, with any scope kind and name", the webhooks defined in the resource hook will be invoked:

```json
{
    "group": "*",
    "scope": {
        "kind": "*",
        "name": "*"
    },
    "kind": "APIService",
    "name": "*",
    "type": [
        "created",
        "updated",
        "deleted"
    ]
}
```

## Advanced setup

### Using a secret

A secret is a key-value pair associated with a webhook to secure it. By setting the secret, you ensure that the `POST` request sent to the payload URL is from Axway.

Example of a payload:

```json
{
    "name": "secrettest",
    "title": "Axway Environment Test",
    "spec": {
        "data": {
            "apikey": "secret"
        }
    }
}
```

* **$name**: the secret unique name.
* **$title**: the secret friendly name.
* **$spec.data**: key value pairs.

Example of a webhook payload referencing a secret:

```json
{
    "name": "webhook",
    "title": "Webhook to invoke requestbin.com",
    "spec": {
        "auth": {
            "secret": {
                "name": "webhooksecret",
                "key": "apikey"
            }
        },
        "enabled": true,
        "url": "https://enveb85y26nv.x.pipedream.net"
    }
}
```

* **$name**: webhook unique identifier.
* **$title**: webhook friendly name.
* **$spec.url**: URL of the server that will receive the webhook `POST`requests.
* **$spec.auth.secret**: use when the webhook is secured and needs a secret to invoke.
* **$spec.auth.secret.name**: name of the secret, as defined in the payload.
* **$spec.auth.secret.key**: key to the secret, which will be used to invoke the webhook.
* **$spec.enabled**: when enabled, will invoke the webhook.

## Configure webhooks on catalog asset subscriptions

Amplify Unified Catalog provides event-driven subscription management capabilities that enable you to create custom subscription flows for each registered environment in Amplify Central, enabling complex approval flows and integration with existing systems to streamline the experience and reduce the time for approval.

To publish an asset to the Amplify Unified Catalog with a custom subscription flow that will be triggered on any subscription events, you must:

* Create an environment in Amplify Central.
* Create an API service, API service instance, and API service revision.
* Create a webhook with a secret, if you want to secure the webhook.
* Create a custom subscription definition that references the webhook.
* Create a consumer instance that references the subscription definition for publishing the asset to the Amplify Unified Catalog.

To configure the resources listed above, see [Axway Central CLI](/docs/integrate_with_central/cli_central/cli_publish/). Alternatively, you can use the example provided in our [Postman Collection](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2125605/SzKbLaVV?version=latest#44df18e7-2802-4786-bd60-7efb7cf5e63a).

The following is an example of a consumer instance with a custom subscription that will trigger a webhook on any subscription change:

```json
{
   "apiVersion":"v1alpha1",
   "kind":"ConsumerSubscriptionDefinition",
   "name":"my-custom-subscription",
   "title":"My custom subscription definition",
   "metadata":{
      "scope":{
         "kind":"Environment",
         "name":"georgiedemoenv"
      }
   },
   "attributes":{
      "createdBy":"json"
   },
   "tags":[
      "custom",
      "subscription"
   ],
   "spec":{
      "webhooks":[
         "my-webhook-name"
      ],
      "schema":{
         "properties":[
            {
               "key":"profile",
               "value":{
                  "$schema":"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
                  "description":"A sample of a custom subscription payload.",
                  "type":"object",
                  "properties":{
                     "Job title":{
                        "type":"string",
                        "description":"Job title"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

* **$spec.webhooks**: array of references to webhook resources, which will be invoked when on subscriptions to a catalog asset that references this subscription definition.
* **$spec.schema**: any valid JSON schema specifying the information required during subscription from the consumers. Amplify Unified Catalog currently only supports JSON schema `draft-04`, so the provided schema in the subscription definition must be [draft-04](http://json-schema.org/).

The following is an example of a consumer instance payload referencing a subscription definition:

```json
{
   "apiVersion":"v1alpha1",
   "kind":"ConsumerInstance",
   "name":"my-catalog-asset",
   "title":"My Demo API v1.0.0",
   "metadata":{
      "scope":{
         "kind":"Environment",
         "name":"my-env-name"
      }
   },
   "attributes":{
      "createdBy":"json"
   },
   "tags":[
      "cli",
      "consumerinst"
   ],
   "spec":{
      "name":"My Demo API v1.0.0",
      "apiServiceInstance":"my-prod-instance",
      "description":"This is an awesome API",
      "visibility":"RESTRICTED",
      "version":"1.0",
      "state":"PUBLISHED",
      "status":"GA",
      "tags":[
         "api",
         "cli"
      ],
      "icon":{
         "contentType":"image/jpeg",
         "data":""
      },
      "documentation":"You can add any documentation in markdown format here",
      "subscription":{
         "enabled":true,
         "autoSubscribe":true,
         "subscriptionDefinition":"my-custom-subscription"
      }
   }
}
```

For the example provided, the following information will be required when a consumer subscribes to a catalog asset from the Amplify Unified Catalog.
