    * Product Foundry provides categories, tags, and attributesâ€¯to facilitate filtering, searching, and grouping of products by different dimensions.

* Comprehensive user documentation.

    * Product Foundry provides a uniform documentation approach for all your Marketplace content.
    * Product Foundry provides support for markdown format, which provides control over the presentation of the information without having to resort to full HTML tagging.
    * Product Foundry provides easy organization of content with articles and sections.

* A subscription plan.

    * Product Foundry provides plans that differentiate between subscription offerings and monetize the product.

To make a product available for consumption by subscribers, the product is published into the Marketplace, which is the storefront into all products exposed for discovery and consumption by internal and / or external consumers.
