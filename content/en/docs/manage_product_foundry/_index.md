The Product Foundry allows users to productize assets and make them ready for consumption / publication in the Amplify Marketplace. Users can build API products by linking multiple assets from across distributed platforms, group assets by domain or target audience, and add documentation describing the value and engagement instructions of the Products. Additionally, it allows users to create and manage products with subscription plans and publish them to the Marketplace for consumption.

## What is a product

A product is a group of linked assets that create a business capability. A product consists of:

* A product profile that describes the product.

    * Product Foundry provides professional looking and aesthetically pleasing products in the Marketplace.

* A grouping of one or more assets that are similar in nature and enable a certain use case when used in conjunction or bundled together.

    * Product Foundry provides categories, tags, and attributesâ€¯to facilitate filtering, searching, and grouping of products by different dimensions.

* Comprehensive user documentation.

    * Product Foundry provides a uniform documentation approach for all your Marketplace content.
    * Product Foundry provides support for markdown format, which provides control over the presentation of the information without having to resort to full HTML tagging.
    * Product Foundry provides easy organization of content with articles and sections.

* A subscription plan.

    * Product Foundry provides plans that allow users to define consumption plans for their products.

To make a product available for consumption by subscribers, the product is published into the Marketplace, which is the storefront into all products exposed for discovery and consumption by internal and / or external consumers. For additional information, see [Manage your Marketplace](/docs/manage_marketplace/).
