Use tags, attributes, and categories to edit the details of your products. This can make the curation and organization of products more valuable.

Tags, attributes and categories are set at the product level, meaning all releases of the product will always look similar. The tags, attributes and categories can be updated any time and does not require a new release of the product.

## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that can be assigned to catalog products and used to search for products. You can create tags with special characters. For example, `_ - & () \ []` and all types of special language characters.

1. Select a product in the *Product Foundry* and open it
2. click on the Tags field in the detail side panel and enter the new tag. To remove a tag, click the **X** next to the tag name.

## Add or remove attributes

Attributes are keyword and value pairs that can be assigned to products and used to search for products. You can create attributes using both lowercase and uppercase. Examples of useful attributes are `state = France` and `city = Paris`.

1. Select a product in the *Product Foundry* and open it.
2. click on the Attributes field in the details side panel and enter the new attribute and value. To remove an attribute, click the **X** next to the attribute key=value.

## Manage categories

Searching through an unordered, unorganized list of products can be a daunting task. However, Central Admin users can create categories to group products in the Amplify Asset Catalog to make searching for products more effective and more organized. Examples of categories are `Finance` and `Medicine`.

Categories allow for a broader grouping of products into different topics or themes. Categories are created once, and multiple products can be assigned to them. One product can be in multiple categories.

Only users that are assigned the **Central Admin** role can create, edit, and delete categories. Categories are created at the Organization level and available to all teams to apply them to their products.

If the product is already published to a marketplace, the change of category will be reflected almost immediately in the marketplace.

1. Select a product in the *Product Foundry*.
2. click on the Categories field in the details side panel and enter the new category. To remove a Category, click the **X** next to the Category name.
