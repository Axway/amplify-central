## Product support contact

The goal of the product support contact is to give the subscriber a way to contact the product provider for any kind of assistance.

Only Catalog Managers can manage the support contact and assigned it to products. The same support contact can be re-used across multiple products.

The support contact is composed of a name, email, phone number associated with office hours and alternative support methods, including: Website URL, Slack channel, or MS Teams channel.

2. Select **Support Contacts**.

View the following information for all support contacts:

* Name - The icon / image representing the product, if any
* Product - Number of associated products
* Email address - The support contact email
* Phone number - The associated phone number

Click on the support contact name to view more information, such as office hours and alternative methods, in the details screen.
