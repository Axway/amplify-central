Manage product support contacts in the Product Foundry UI, including: create, assign to a product, edit, and delete.

## Before you start

* You must have a user account with Catalog Manager rights to manage the support contact.
* All Catalog Manager users will be able to use any existing support contacts.

## Objectives

Learn how to manage product support contacts and assigned them to new or existing products.

## Product support contact

The goal of the product support contact is to give the subscriber a way to contact the product provider for any kind of assistance.

Only Catalog Managers can manage the support contact and assigned it to products. The same support contact can be re-used across multiple products.

The support contact is composed of a name, email, phone number associated with office hours and alternative support methods, including: Website URL, Slack channel, or MS Teams channel.

### View a product support contact

1. Navigate to *Catalog > Product Foundry*.
2. Select **Support Contacts**.

View the following information for all support contacts:

* Name - The icon / image representing the product, if any
* Product - Number of associated products
* Email address - The support contact email
* Phone number - The associated phone number

Click on the support contact name to view more information, such as office hours and alternative methods, in the details screen.

### Create a product support contact

1. Navigate to *Catalog > Product Foundry*.
2. Select **Support Contacts**.
3. Click **+ Add Contact** to add a new product support contact.
4. The product support contact wizard opens. This wizard is composed of two pages: one for the support contact information and one for the product association.
5. Add the following and then click **Next**:

    * Contact Name - The display name for the support contact in the Marketplace UI.
    * Email addresses - The support contact email address.
    * Phone number (optional) - The support contact phone information.
    * Office hours (optional) - The day(s) and time periods when the phone will be answered. If the time frame is different from one day to another, click **+ Add Office Hours** to add a different period. Be aware that a day cannot be assigned to multiple periods.
    * Alternative method (optional) - Up to five different methods, including: Website URL, MS Teams channel or Slack channel. These alternative methods require a title that will be displayed in the Marketplace UI and its effective URL. This URL will be used to redirect the consumer to the appropriate information.

6. For Access Rights, select the team that owns the support contact. Select the team(s) the support contact can be shared with. By default, a support contact is not shared and only the **Engage Admin** or the owning team will have access to it. If you want your support contact shared with a specific team, select a team owner, and then select all the teams you want to grant "Rights" to the selected asset. For each of the teams selected, you can choose either Edit or Read access "Rights." Each member of the shared team(s) selected will be able to access your support contact with the chosen "Rights." This allows you to share/enable access to a specific asset without granting access to all the assets owned by your current team. Click **Next**.
7. Select the assigned product where this contact will be displayed. Selected products will be added to the *Associated products* section.
8. click **Save**.

The product support contact is saved and assigned to all selected products. Consumers can view the support contact information on the right of the product details screen in the Marketplace.

### Assign a support contact when creating a product

You can assign a support contact when creating a product with the product creation wizard. This allows the Catalog Manager to either select an existing support contact or create a new one from a side panel. If you create a new support contact, it is available to other users immediately after you click **Create*, even if you cancel the product creation.

### Delete a product support contact

To delete, the product support contact cannot be assigned to any product.
