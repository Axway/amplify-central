The **Consumer Journey** in Amplify Engage describes how developers and partners discover, subscribe to, and consume products published in the Marketplace. This journey ensures that consumers have a consistent experience when exploring available APIs and assets, requesting access, managing credentials, and tracking their usage.

The consumer journey follows these key stages:

---

## Browse the Marketplace

Consumers begin by browsing the **Marketplace** to find products that match their needs.  
The Marketplace provides a curated catalog of APIs and digital assets with documentation, usage instructions, and subscription options.

## Subscribe to a Product

Once a product of interest is identified, consumers can **subscribe** to it to gain access.  
A **subscription** represents the formal binding contract between an API consumer and the product within Amplify Engage. By subscribing, the consumer’s application is granted access to a product under the terms defined by the usage plan. When selecting a subscription plan, the consumer agrees to the associated usage limits, quotas, or rate restrictions.

## View Subscription Status

Consumers can view and track the status of their active subscriptions in the Marketplace.  
This includes details such as subscription state (pending, approved, active), usage plan, and associated applications.

## Register Application

For products that include APIs or other protected resources, consumers may need to **Register Application** to **request access** to specific resources.  
This step ensures that usage is governed by provider-defined policies and access controls.

## Request Credentials

To authenticate and consume the product resources, consumers can generate or request **credentials** (such as API keys or OAuth tokens).  
Amplify Engage automates credential issuance and ties them to the consumer’s subscription.

## Gain Insights into Consumption

Consumers can view **insights** into their API consumption, including metrics on traffic, errors, and quota usage.  
This visibility helps developers monitor integration performance and optimize their usage of subscribed products.
