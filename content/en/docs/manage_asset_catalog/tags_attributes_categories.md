Use tags, attributes, and categories to edit the details of your assets. This can make the curation and organization of assets more valuable.

## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that can be assigned to catalog assets and used to search for assets. You can create tags with special characters. For example, `_ - & () \ []` and all types of special language characters.

1. Select an asset in the *Asset Catalog*.
2. Either select an asset version in the Draft state or click either **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset** in the details side panel.

    * If draft version, click on the Tags field in the detail side panel and enter the new tag. To remove a tag, click the **X** next to the tag name.
    * If **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset**, click **Categories, Tags, & Attributes** in the wizard. Then click on the Tags field and enter the new tag. To remove a tag, click the **X** next to the tag name.

3. Press **Enter** or click **+** to add the new tag to the list of tags.
4. Click **Save** or **Save Draft & Exit**.

## Add or remove attributes

Attributes are keyword and value pairs that can be assigned to assets and used to search for assets. You can create attributes using both lowercase and uppercase. Examples of useful attributes are `state = France` and `city = Paris`.

1. Select an asset in the *Asset Catalog*.
2. Either select an asset version in the Draft state or click either **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset** in the details side panel.

    * If draft version, click on the Attributes field in the details side panel and enter the new attribute and value. To remove an attribute, click the **X** next to the attribute key=value.
    * If **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset**, click **Categories, Tags, & Attributes** in the Wizard. Then click on the Attribute field and enter the new attribute Key and Value. To remove a category, click the **X** next to the attribute key=value.

3. Press **Enter** or click **+** to add the new attribute to the list of attributes.
4. Click **Save** or **Save Draft & Exit**.

## Manage categories

Searching through an unordered, unorganized list of assets can be a dauting task. However, Central Admin users can create categories to group assets in the Amplify Asset Catalog to make searching for assets more effective and more organized. Examples of categories are `Finance` and `Medicine`.

Categories allow for a broader grouping of assets into different topics or themes. Categories are created once, and multiple assets can be assigned to them. One asset can be in multiple categories.

Only users that are assigned the **Central Admin** role can create, edit, and delete categories. Categories are created at the Organization level and available to all teams to apply them to their assets.

1. Select an asset in the *Asset Catalog*.
2. Either select an asset version in the Draft state or click either **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset** in the details side panel.

    * If draft version, click on the Categories field in the details side panel and enter the new category. To remove a Category, click the **X** next to the Category name.
    * If **Create Draft** or **Edit Asset**, click **Categories, Tags, & Attributes** in the Wizard. Then click on the Category field and enter the new Category. To remove a category, click **X** next to the category name.

3. Press **Enter** or click **+** to add the new category to the list of categories.
4. Click **Save** or **Save Draft & Exit**.
