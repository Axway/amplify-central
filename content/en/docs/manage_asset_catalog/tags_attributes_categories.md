Use tags, attributes, and categories to edit the details of your assets. This can make the curation and organization of assets more valuable.

## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that can assigned to catalog assets and used to search for assets. You can create tags with any special characters. For example, `_ - & () \ []` and all types of special language characters can be used to create tags.

1. Select an asset in the **Asset Catalog.**
2. Either select a asset version in the Draft state or click on <Create Draft> or <Edit Asset> buttons on the right-side details.  \
   If a draft version was selected, then in the right-side details panel, click on the Tags field and enter your new tag to be added.  To remove a tag, click on the X next to the tag name.\
   If you selected <Create Draft> or <Edit Asset>, the wizard will appear and click on <Categories, Tags, & Attributes>.  Then click on the Tags field and enter your new tag to be added.  To remove a tag, click on the X next to the tag name.
3. Press `Enter` or click on the + sign to add the new tag you have typed to the list of tags.
4. Click **Save** or **Save Draft & Exit.**

## Add or remove attributes

Attributes are keyword and value pairs that can be assigned to assets and used to search for assets. You can create attributes using both lowercase and uppercase.  An example of useful attributes are `state = France` or `city = Paris`.

## Manage categories

Searching through an unordered list of assets can become a dauting tasks and make assets less organized. Central Admin and Product Manager users can create categories to group assets in the Amplify Asset Catalog to make searching for assets more effective and more organized. Examples of categories are `Finance` or `Medicine`.

Categories allow for a broader grouping of assets into different topics or themes. They are created once, and multiple assets can be assigned to them. One asset can be in multiple categories.

Only users that are assigned the **Central Admin** or **Product Manager** role can create, edit and delete categories. Categories are created at the Organization level and available to all teams to apply them to their assets.
