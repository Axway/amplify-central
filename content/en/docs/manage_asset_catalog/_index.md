The Asset Catalog allows users to organize, curate and group APIs, so they can be packaged into products to ultimately be consumed by customers, partners, and internal developers from the Marketplace. See [Asset management](/docs/manage_asset_catalog/asset_management/) for additional information.

The targeted user of the Asset Catalog is typically someone who has knowledge of the different APIs, knows which APIs belong together, and which APIs are relevant for consumption in the Marketplace.

## What is an asset

An asset is a grouping of API Services that:

* Are similar in nature but running on different data planes. For example, Petstore API 1.0 in Axway API Gateway and Petstore API 1.0 in Azure Gateway can be grouped in a Petstore API.

* Have a functionality that makes them complimentary. For example, Employee API, HR Administration API, and PayRoll API can be grouped in an HR asset.

* Are similar in nature but have been adapted for a specific geography. For example, Payment Europe API and Payments US API can be grouped in a Payments API.

The asset model is flexible, so APIs can be group to suit individual needs.

Once the Asset Catalog has been used to manage and group API Services into assets, they are deployed as products in the [Product Foundry](/docs/manage_product_foundry) where they can be attached to subscription plans and consumed from the [Marketplace](/docs/manage_marketplace).

For information on the lifecycle of an asset, see [Asset lifecycle](/docs/manage_asset_catalog/asset_lifecycle/).
