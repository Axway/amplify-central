The access rights of an asset define the Team Onwership and Team sharing of an asset.
The Team Ownership is the team which owns and has the permissions to the asset.   The level of permissions is defined by your role on the Amplify platform.
The Team Sharing is the team(s) which have read only access to the asset.  The Team Sharing uses an Access Control List (ACL) to define the list of teams the asset is shared with.
