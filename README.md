# Amplify-Central

Amplify-Central is a docs-as-code implementation for Axway documentation. It is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with the [Google Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme. The site is deployed on Netlify at <https://amplify-central.netlify.app/>.

This repository contains all files for building and deploying the site. The Markdown files for the documentation are stored at `/content/en/docs`.
